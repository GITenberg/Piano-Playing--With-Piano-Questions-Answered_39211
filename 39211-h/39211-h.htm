<hr style="width: 65%;" /> <h3><a name="A_FOREWORD" id="A_FOREWORD"></a>A FOREWORD</h3>


<p>This little book purposes to present a general view of artistic
piano-playing and to offer to young students the results of such
observations as I have made in the years of my own studies, as well as
of the experiences which my public activity has brought me.</p>

<p>It is, of course, only the concrete, the material side of piano-playing
that can be dealt with here&mdash;that part of it which aims to
reproduce in tones what is plainly stated in the printed lines of a
composition. The other, very much subtler part of piano-playing, draws
upon and, indeed, depends upon imagination, refinement of sensibility,
and spiritual vision, and endeavours to convey to an audience what the
composer has, consciously or unconsciously, hidden <i>between</i> the lines.
That almost entirely psychic side of piano-playing eludes treatment in
literary form and must, therefore, not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvia" id="Page_xvia">Pg xvi</a></span> looked for in this
little volume. It may not be amiss, however, to dwell a moment upon
these elusive matters of &#xe6;sthetics and conception, though it be only to
show how far apart they are from technic.</p>

<p>When the material part, the technic, has been completely acquired by the
piano student, he will see a limitless vista opening up before him,
disclosing the vast field of artistic interpretation. In this field the
work is largely of an analytical nature and requires that intelligence,
spirit, and sentiment, supported by knowledge and &#xe6;sthetic perception,
form a felicitous union to produce results of value and dignity. It is
in this field that the student must learn to perceive the invisible
something which unifies the seemingly separate notes, groups, periods,
sections, and parts into an organic whole. The spiritual eye for this
invisible something is what musicians have in mind when they speak of
"reading between the lines"&mdash;which is at once the most fascinating
and most difficult task of the interpretative artist; for, it is just
between the lines where, in literature as in music, the soul of a work
of art lies hid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviia" id="Page_xviia">Pg xvii</a></span>den. To play its notes, even to play them
correctly, is still very far from doing justice to the life and soul of
an artistic composition.</p>

<p>I should like to reiterate at this point two words which I used in the
second paragraph: the words "consciously or unconsciously." A brief
comment upon this alternative may lead to observations which may throw a
light upon the matter of reading between the lines, especially as I am
rather strongly inclining toward the belief in the "unconscious" side of
the alternative.</p>

<p>I believe that every composer of talent (not to speak of genius) in his
moments of creative fever has given birth to thoughts, ideas, designs
that lay altogether beyond the reach of his conscious will and control.
In speaking of the products of such periods we have hit upon exactly the
right word when we say that the composer "has surpassed himself." For,
in saying this we recognise that the act of surpassing one's self
precludes the control of the self. A critical, sober overseeing of one's
work during the period of creation is unthinkable, for it is the fancy
and the imagination that carries one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviiia" id="Page_xviiia">Pg xviii</a></span> on and on, will-lessly,
driftingly, until the totality of the tonal apparition is completed and
mentally as well as physically absorbed.</p>

<p>Now, inasmuch as the composer's conscious will takes little or no part
in the creating of the work, it seems to follow that he is not,
necessarily, an absolute authority as to the "only correct way" of
rendering it. Pedantic adherence to the composer's own conception is, to
my mind, not an unassailable maxim. The composer's way of rendering his
composition may not be free from certain predilections, biases,
mannerisms, and his rendition may also suffer from a paucity of
pianistic experience. It seems, therefore, that to do justice to the
work itself is of far greater importance than a slavish adherence to the
composer's conception.</p>

<p>Now, to discover what it is, intellectually or emotionally, that hides
itself between the lines; how to conceive and how to interpret
it&mdash;that must ever rest with the reproductive artist, provided that
he possesses not only the spiritual vision which entitles him to an
individual conception, but also the technical skill to express what this
individual conception (aided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xixa" id="Page_xixa">Pg xix</a></span> imagination and analysis) has
whispered to him. Taking these two conditions for granted, his
interpretations&mdash;however punctiliously he adhere to the
text&mdash;will and must be a reflex of his breeding, education,
temperament, disposition; in short, of all the faculties and qualities
that go to make up his personality. And as these personal qualities
differ between players, their interpretations must, necessarily, differ
in the same measure.</p>

<p>In some respects the performance of a piece of music resembles the
reading of a book aloud to some one. If a book should be read to us by a
person who does not understand it, would it impress us as true,
convincing, or even credible? Can a dull person, by reading them to us,
convey bright thoughts intelligibly? Even if such a person were drilled
to read with outward correctness that of which he cannot fathom the
meaning, the reading could not seriously engage our attention, because
the reader's want of understanding would be sure to effect a lack of
interest in us. Whatever is said to an audience, be the speech literary
or musical, must be a free and individual expres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxa" id="Page_xxa">Pg xx</a></span>sion, governed
only by general or is it &#xe6;sthetic laws or rules; it must be free to be
artistic, and it must be individual to have vital force. Traditional
conceptions of works of art are "canned goods," unless the individual
happens to concur with the traditional conception, which, at best, is
very rarely the case and does not speak well for the mental calibre of
the easily contented treader of the beaten path.</p>

<p>We know how precious a thing is freedom. But in modern times it is not
only precious, it is also costly; it is based upon certain possessions.
This holds as good in life as in art. To move comfortably with freedom
in life requires money; freedom in art requires a sovereign mastery of
technic. The pianist's artistic bank-account upon which he can draw at
any moment is his technic. We do not gauge him by it as an artist, to be
sure, but rather by the use he makes of it; just as we respect the
wealthy according to the way in which they use their money. And as there
are wealthy people that are vulgar, so there may be pianists who,
despite the greatest technic, are not artists. Still, while money is to
a gentleman perhaps no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxia" id="Page_xxia">Pg xxi</a></span>
more than a rather agreeable adjunct,
technic is to the pianist's equipment an indispensable necessity.</p>

<p>To assist young students in acquiring this necessity, the following
articles were written for <i>The Ladies' Home Journal</i>, and for this form
I have gone over them and corrected and amplified. I sincerely hope that
they will help my young colleagues to become free as piano-playing
musicians first, and that this, in its turn and with the help of good
fortune in their career, will bring them the means to make them equally
free in their daily life.</p>

<p>The first requisite for one who wishes to become a musicianly and
artistic pianist is a precise knowledge of the possibilities and
limitations of the piano as an instrument. Having properly recognised
them both, having thus staked off a stretch of ground for his activity,
he must explore it to discover all the resources for tonal expression
that are hidden within its pale. With these resources, however, he must
be contented. He must, above all, never strive to rival the orchestra.
For there is no necessity to attempt anything so foolish and so futile,
since the gamut of expressions inherent to the piano is quite extensive
enough to vouchsafe artistic results of the very highest order,
provided, of course, that this gamut is used in an artistic
manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4a" id="Page_4a">Pg 4</a></span></p>


<h5>THE PIANO AND THE ORCHESTRA</h5>

<p>From one point of view the piano can claim to be the equal of the
orchestra; namely, in so far as it is&mdash;no less than the
orchestra&mdash;the exponent of a specific branch of music which,
complete by itself, reposes upon a literature exclusively its own and of
a type so distinguished that only the orchestra can claim to possess its
peer. The great superiority of the literature of the piano over that of
any other single instrument has, to my knowledge, never been disputed. I
think it is equally certain that the piano grants to its players a
greater freedom of expression than any other instrument;
greater&mdash;in certain respects&mdash;than even the orchestra, and
very much greater than the organ, which, after all, lacks the intimate,
personal element of "touch" and the immediateness of its variegated
results.</p>

<p>In dynamic and colouristic qualities, on the other hand, the piano
cannot bear comparison with the orchestra; for in these qualities it is
very limited indeed. The prudent player will not go beyond these limits.
The utmost that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">Pg 5</a></span>
the pianist can achieve in the way of colour may
be likened to what the painters call "monochrome." For in reality the
piano, like any other instrument, has only one colour; but the artistic
player can subdivide the colour into an infinite number and variety of
shades. The virtue of a specific charm, too, attaches as much to the
piano as to other instruments, though, perhaps, in a lesser degree of
sensuousness than to some others. Is it because of this lesser sensuous
charm that the art of the piano is considered the chastest of all
instruments? I am rather inclined to think that it is, partly at least,
due to this chastity that it "wears" best, that we can listen longer to
a piano than to other instruments, and that this chastity may have had a
reflex action upon the character of its unparagoned literature.</p>

<p>For this literature, though, we have to thank the pianists themselves,
or, speaking more precisely, we are indebted to the circumstance that
the piano is the only single instrument capable of conveying the
complete entity of a composition. That melody, bass, harmony,
figuration, polyphony, and the most intricate contrapuntal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a">Pg 6</a></span>
devices can&mdash;by skilful hands&mdash;be rendered simultaneously and
(to all intents and purposes) completely on the piano has probably been
the inducement which persuaded the great masters of music to choose it
as their favourite instrument.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned at this point that the piano did not have the effect
of impairing the orchestration of the great composers&mdash;as some
musical wiseacres assert from time to time&mdash;for they have written
just as fine works for a variety of other instruments, not to speak of
their symphonies. Thus has, for instance, the most substantial part of
the violin literature been contributed by piano-players (Bach, Mozart,
Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Bruch, Saint-Sa&#xeb;ns, Tschaikowski, and
many others). As to the literature of the orchestra, it came almost
exclusively from those masters whose only, or chiefest, medium of
musical utterance was the piano. Highly organised natures, as they were,
they liked to dress their thoughts, sometimes, in the colour splendour
of the orchestra. Looking at the depth of their piano works, however, at
their sterling merit, at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7a" id="Page_7a">Pg 7</a></span>
poetry, I feel that even a refined
musical nature may find lifelong contentment in the piano&mdash;despite
its limitations&mdash;if, as I said before, the artist keeps within its
boundaries and commands its possibilities. For it is, after all, not so
very little that the piano has to offer. It is both governed and
manipulated by one and the same mind and person; its mechanism is so
fine and yet so simple as to make its tone response quite as direct as
that of any other stringed instrument; it admits of the thoroughly
personal element of touch; it requires no auxiliary instruments (for
even in the Concerto the orchestra is not a mere accompanist but an
equal partner, as the name "Concerto" implies); its limitations are not
as bad as those of some other instruments or of the voice; it outweighs
these limitations very fairly by the vast wealth of its dynamic and
touch varieties. Considering all these and many other points of merit, I
think that a musician may be pretty well satisfied with being a pianist.
His realm is in more than one respect smaller than that of the
conductor, to be sure, but on the other hand the conductor loses many
lovely moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8a" id="Page_8a">Pg 8</a></span>
of sweet intimacy which are granted to the pianist
when, world-oblivious and alone with his instrument he can commune with
his innermost and best self. Consecrated moments, these, which he would
exchange with no musician of any other type and which wealth can neither
buy nor power compel.</p>

<h5>THE PIANO AND THE PLAYER</h5>

<p>Music makers are, like the rest of mankind, not free from sin. On the
whole, however, I think that the transgressions of pianists against the
canons of art are less grave and less frequent than those of other music
makers; perhaps, because they are&mdash;usually&mdash;better grounded as
musicians than are singers and such players of other instruments as the
public places on a par with the pianists I have in mind. But, while
their sins may be less in number and gravity&mdash;let it be well
understood that the pianists are no saints. Alas, no! It is rather
strange, though, that their worst misdeeds are induced by that very
virtue of the piano of requiring no auxiliary instruments, of being
independent. If it were not so; if the pianist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9a" id="Page_9a">Pg 9</a></span> were compelled
always to play in company with other musicians, these other players
might at times differ with him as to conception, tempo, etc., and their
views and wishes should have to be reckoned with, for the sake of both
equilibrium and&mdash;sweet peace.</p>

<p>Left entirely to himself, however, as the pianist usually is in his
performances, he sometimes yields to a tendency to move altogether too
freely, to forget the deference due to the composition and its creator,
and to allow his much-beloved "individuality" to glitter with a false
and presumptuous brightness. Such a pianist does not only fail in his
mission as an interpreter but he also misjudges the possibilities of the
piano. He will, for instance, try to produce six <i>forte-s</i> when the
piano has not more than three to give, all told, except at a sacrifice
of its dignity and its specific charm.</p>

<p>The extremest contrasts, the greatest <i>forte</i> and the finest <i>piano</i>,
are given factors determined by the individual piano, by the player's
skill of touch, and by the acoustic properties of the hall. These given
factors the pianist must bear in mind, as well as the limitations of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10a" id="Page_10a">Pg 10</a></span>
piano as to colour, if he means to keep clear of
dilettanteism and charlatanry. A nice appreciation of the realm over
which he rules, as to its boundaries and possibilities, must be the
supreme endeavour of every sovereign&mdash;hence also of every sovereign
musician.</p>

<p>Now, I hear it so often said of this and that pianist that "he plays
with <i>so</i> much feeling" that I cannot help wondering if he does not,
sometimes at least, play with "<i>so</i> much feeling" where it is not in the
least called for and where "<i>so</i> much feeling" constitutes a decided
trespass against the &#xe6;sthetic boundaries of the composition. My
apprehension is usually well founded, for the pianist that plays
<i>everything</i> "with so much feeling" is an artist in name only, but in
reality a sentimentalist, if not a vulgar sensationalist or a ranter
upon the keyboard. What sane pianist would, for instance, attempt to
play a cantilena with the same appealing sensuousness as the most
mediocre 'cellist can do with the greatest ease? Yet many pianists
attempt it; but since they are fully aware that they can never attain
such ends by legitimate, artistic means, they make either the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page11" id="Page11">Pg 11</a></span> accompaniment or the rhythm, if not
the phrasing, bear the brunt of their palpable dilettanteism. Of such
illusory endeavours I cannot warn too strongly, for they are bound to
destroy the organic relation of the melody to its auxiliaries and to
change the musical "physiognomy" of a piece into a&mdash;"grimace:" This
fault reveals that the pianist's spirit&mdash;of adventure&mdash;is too
willing, but the flesh&mdash;of the fingers and their technic&mdash;too
weak.</p>

<p>The artistic and the dilettantic manners of expression must be sharply
differentiated. They differ, principally, as follows: the artist knows
and feels how far the responsiveness of his instrument, at any
particular part of his piece, will allow him to go without violating
&#xe6;sthetics, and without stepping outside of the nature of his instrument.
He shapes his rendition of the piece accordingly and practises wise
economy in the use of force and in the display of feeling. As to
feeling, <i>per se</i>, it is the ripe product of a multitude of &#xe6;sthetic
processes which the moment creates and develops; but the artist will
keep this product from asserting itself until he has complied with every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page12" id="Page12">Pg 12</a></span>
requirement of artistic <i>workmanship</i>; until he has, so to
speak, provided a cleanly covered and fully set table upon which these
matters of "feeling" appear as finishing, decorative touches, say, as
flowers.</p>

<p>The dilettante, on the other hand, does not consume any time by thinking
and planning; he simply "goes for" his piece and, without bothering
about workmanship or squirming around it as best he may, he rambles off
into&mdash;"feeling," which in his case consists of naught but vague,
formless, aimless, and purely sensuous sentimentality. His accompaniment
drowns the melody, his rhythm goes on a sympathetic strike, dynamic and
other artistic properties become hysterical; no matter,
he&mdash;"feels"! He builds a house in which the cellar is under the
roof and the garret in the basement.</p>

<p>Let it be said in extenuation of such a player that he is not always and
seldom wholly to blame for his wrong-doing. Very often he strays from
the path of musical rectitude because of his misplaced trust in the
judgment of others, which causes him to accept and follow advice<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page13" id="Page13">Pg 13</a></span> in good faith, instead of duly
considering its source. For, under certain conditions, the advice of
even a connoisseur may be wrong. Many professional and well-equipped
critics, for instance, fall into the bad habit of expecting that a
pianist should tell all he knows in every piece he plays, whether the
piano does or does not furnish the opportunities for displaying all his
qualities. They expect him to show strength, temperament, passion,
poise, sentiment, repose, depth, and so forth, in the first piece on his
programme. He must tell his whole story, present himself at once as a
"giant" or "Titan" of the piano, though the piece may call for naught
but tenderness. With this demand, or the alternative of a "roasting,"
public artists are confronted rather frequently. Nor is this, perhaps,
as much the fault of the critic as of the conditions under which they
must write. From my own experience and that of others I know that the
critics in large cities are so overburdened with work during the season
that they have seldom time to listen to more than one piece out of a
whole recital programme. After such a mere sample they form<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page14" id="Page14">Pg 14</a></span> their opinions&mdash;so momentous
for the career of a young pianist&mdash;and if this one piece happened
to offer no opportunities to the pianist to show himself as the "great"
So-and-so, why, then he is simply put down as one of the
"littlefellows." It is no wonder that such conditions tempt many young
aspirants to public renown to resort to &#xe6;sthetic violence in order to
make sure of "good notices"; to use power where it is not called for; to
make "feeling" ooze from every pore; to double, treble the tempo or
vacillate it out of all rhythm; to violate the boundaries of both the
composition and the instrument&mdash;and all this for no other purpose
than to show as quickly as possible that the various qualities are "all
there." These conditions produce what may be called the pianistic
nouveau-riche or parvenu, who practises the vices of the dilettante
without, however, the mitigating excuse of ignorance or a lack of
training.</p>

<h5>THE PIANIST AND THE COMPOSITION</h5>

<p>As the piano, so has also every composition its limitations as to the
range of its emotions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page15" id="Page15">Pg 15</a></span>
and their artistic expression. The hints
in this direction I threw out before may now be amplified by discussing
a very common error which underlies the matter of conception. It is the
error of inferring the conception of a composition <i>from the name of its
composer</i>; of thinking that Beethoven has to be played thus and Chopin
thus. No error could be greater!</p>

<p>True, every great composer has his own style, his habitual mode of
thought development, his personality revealing lines. But it is equally
true that the imagination of all great composers was strong enough to
absorb them as completely in their own creation as the late Pygmalion
was absorbed in his Galatea, and to lure them, for the time being,
completely away from their habits of thought and expression; they become
the willing servants of the new creature of their own fancy. Thus we
find some of Beethoven's works as romantic and fanciful as any of
Schumann's or Chopin's could be, while some of the latter's works show
at times a good deal of Beethovenish classicity. It is, therefore,
utterly wrong to approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page16" id="Page16">Pg 16</a></span>
every work of Beethoven with the
preconceived idea that it must be "deep" and "majestic," or, if the work
be Chopin's, that it must run over with sensuousness and "feeling." How
would such a style of rendition do, for instance, for the Polonaise op.
53, or even for the little one in A, op. 40, No. 1? On the other hand,
how would the stereotype, academic manner of playing Beethoven suit his
Concerto in G&mdash;that poetic presage of Chopin?</p>

<p>Every great master has written some works that are, and some that are
not, typical of himself. In the latter cases the master's identity
reveals itself only to an eye that is experienced enough to detect it in
the smaller, more minute traits of his style. Such delicate features,
however, must be left in their discreet nooks and niches; they must not
be clumsily dragged into the foreground for the sake of a traditional
rendition of the piece. That sort of "reverence" is bound to obliterate
all the peculiarities of the particular, non-typical composition. It is
not reverence, but fetichism. Justice to the composer means justice to
his works; to every work in particular. And this justice we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page17" id="Page17">Pg 17</a></span> learn from the reading of his
biography, but by regarding every one of his works as a separate and
complete entity; as a perfect, organic whole of which we must study the
general character, the special features, the form, the manner of design,
the emotional course, and the trend of thought. Much more than by his
biography we will be helped, in forming our conception, by comparing the
work in hand with others of the same master, though the comparison may
disclose just as many differences of style as it may show similarities.</p>

<p>The worship of names, the unquestioning acquiescence in traditional
conceptions&mdash;those are not the principles which will lead an artist
to come into his own. It is rather a close examination of every popular
notion, a severe testing of every tradition by the touchstone of
self-thinking that will help an artist to find himself and to see, what
he does see, with his own eyes.</p>

<p>Thus we find that&mdash;in a certain constructive meaning&mdash;even the
reverence for the composer is not without boundaries; though these
boundary lines are drawn here only to secure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page18" id="Page18">Pg 18</a></span> widest possible
freedom for their work. Goethe's great word expresses most tersely what
I mean:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Outwardly limited,</span><br /> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Boundless to inward.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page19" id="Page19">Pg 19</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /> <h3><a name="GENERAL_RULES" id="GENERAL_RULES"></a>GENERAL RULES</h3>

<p>Successful piano-playing, if it cannot be entirely acquired by some very
simple rules, can, at least, be very much helped by what will seem to
some as contributing causes so slight as to be hardly worth notice.
Still, they are immensely valuable, and I will endeavour to set down a
few.</p>

<p><i>The Value of the Morning Hour</i> above any other time is not generally
appreciated. The mental freshness gained from sleep is a tremendous
help. I go so far as to say play away for an hour, or a half hour even,
before breakfast. But before you touch the piano let me suggest one very
prosaic little hint: wash the keyboard as clean as you did your hands.
Eating always tastes best from a clean table. Just so with the piano:
you cannot do clean work on an unclean keyboard.</p>

<p><i>Now, as to Practice</i>: Let me suggest that you never practise more than
an hour, or, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page20" id="Page20">Pg 20</a></span> the most, two hours, at a
stretch&mdash;according to your condition and strength. Then go out and
take a walk, and think no more of music. This method of mental
unhitching, so to speak, is absolutely necessary in order that the newly
acquired results of your work may&mdash;unconsciously to
yourself&mdash;mature in your mind and get, as it were, into your flesh
and blood. That which you have newly learned must become affixed to your
entire organism, very much like the picture on a photographic plate is
developed and affixed by the silver bath. If you allow Nature no time
for this work the result of your previous efforts will vanish and you
will have to begin all over again with your&mdash;photographing. Yes,
photographing! For every acoustic or tone picture is, through the agency
of the ear, photographed in the brain, and the whole occupation of the
pianist consists in the reproduction of the previously received
impressions through the fingers, which, with the help of the instrument,
retranslate the pictures into audible tones.</p>

<p>After every half hour make a pause until you feel rested. Five minutes
will often be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page21" id="Page21">Pg 21</a></span>
sufficient. Follow the example of the painter,
who closes his eyes for a few moments in order to obtain upon reopening
them a fresh color impression.</p>

<p><i>A Valuable Little Hint Here</i>, if you will allow me: Watch well that you
actually hear every tone you mean to produce. Every missing tone will
mean a blotch upon your photographic plate in the brain. Each note must
be, not mentally but physically, heard, and to this imperative
requirement your speed must ever subordinate itself. It is not at all
necessary to practise loudly in order to foster the permanence of
impressions. Rather let an inward tension take the place of external
force. It will engage, sympathetically, your hearing just as well.</p>

<p><i>As to the Theory</i>&mdash;great energy, great results&mdash;I prefer my
amended version: great energy, restrained power and moderate
manifestation of it. Prepare the finger for great force, imagine the
tone as being strong, and yet strike moderately. Continuous loud playing
makes our playing coarse. On the other hand, continuous soft playing
will blur the tone picture in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page22" id="Page22">Pg 22</a></span>
our mind and cause us soon to play
insecurely and wrongly. From time to time we should, of course, practise
loudly so as to develop physical endurance. But for the greater part of
practice I recommend playing with restrained power. And, incidentally,
your neighbours will thank you for it, too.</p>

<p><i>Do Not Practise Systematically</i>, or "methodically," as it is sometimes
called. Systematism is the death of spontaneousness, and spontaneousness
is the very soul of art. If you play every day at the same time the same
sequence of the same studies and the same pieces, you may acquire a
certain degree of skill, perhaps, but the spontaneity of your rendition
will surely be lost. Art belongs to the realm of emotional
manifestations, and it stands to reason that a systematic exploiting of
our emotional nature must blunt it.</p>

<p><i>With Regard to Finger Exercises</i>: Do not let them be too frequent or
too long&mdash;at the most a half hour a day. A half hour daily, kept up
for a year, is enough for any one to learn to play one's exercises. And
if one can play them why should one keep everlastingly on<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page23" id="Page23">Pg 23</a></span> playing them? Can anybody explain,
without reflecting upon one's sanity, why one should persist in playing
them? I suggest to use these exercises as "preliminary warmers" (as
practised in engines). As soon as the hands have become warm and
elastic, or pliable&mdash;"played in," as we pianists say&mdash;drop the
exercises and repeat them for the same purpose the next morning, if you
will. They can be successfully substituted, however. As compositions
they are but lukewarm water. If you will dip your hands, instead, for
five minutes into hot water you will follow my own method and find it
just as efficacious.</p>

<p><i>A Rule for Memory Exercises</i>: If you wish to strengthen the receptivity
and retentiveness of your memory you will find the following plan
practical: Start with a short piece. Analyse the form and manner of its
texture. Play the piece a number of times very exactly with the music
before you. Then stop playing for several hours and try to trace the
course of ideas mentally in the piece. Try to hear the piece inwardly.
If you have retained some parts refill the missing places by repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page24" id="Page24">Pg 24</a></span>
reading of the piece, away from the piano. When next you go to
the piano&mdash;after several hours, remember&mdash;try to play the
piece. Should you still get "stuck" at a certain place take the sheet
music, but play only that place (several times, if necessary), and then
begin the piece over again, as a test, if you have better luck this time
with those elusive places. If you still fail resume your silent reading
of the piece away from the piano. Under no circumstances skip the unsafe
place for the time being, and proceed with the rest of the piece. By
such forcing of the memory you lose the logical development of your
piece, tangle up your memory and injure its receptivity. Another
observation in connection with memorising may find a place here. When we
study a piece we&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;associate in our mind a
multitude of things with it which bear not the slightest relation upon
it. By these "things" I mean not only the action of the piano, light or
heavy, as it may be, but also the colour of its wood, the colour of the
wall paper, discoloration of the ivory on some key of the piano, the
pictures on the walls, the angle at which the piano stands<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page25" id="Page25">Pg 25</a></span> to the architectural lines of the
room, in short, all sorts of things. And we remain utterly unconscious
of having associated them with the piece we are studying&mdash;until we
try to play the well-learned piece in a different place, in the house of
a friend or, if we are inexperienced enough to commit such a blunder, in
the concert hall. Then we find that our memory fails us most
unexpectedly, and we blame our memory for its unreliableness. But the
fact is rather that our memory was only too good, too exact, for the
absence of or difference from our accustomed surroundings disturbed our
too precise memory. Hence, to make absolutely sure of our memory we
should try our piece in a number of different places before relying upon
our memory; this will dissociate the wonted environment from the piece
in our memory.</p>

<p><i>With Regard to Technical Work</i>: Play good compositions and construe out
of them your own technical exercises. In nearly every piece you play you
will find a place or two of which your conscience tells you that they
are not up to your own wishes; that they can be improved upon either
from a rhythmical, dynamical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page26" id="Page26">Pg 26</a></span>or precisional point of view. Give
these places the preference for a while, but do not fail to play from
time to time again the whole piece in order to put the erstwhile
defective and now repaired part into proper relation to its context.
Remember that a difficult part may "go" pretty well when severed from
its context and yet fail utterly when attempted in its proper place. You
must follow the mechanic in this. If a part of a machine is perfected in
the shop it must still go through the process of being
"mounted"&mdash;that is, being brought into proper relation to the
machine itself&mdash;and this often requires additional packing or
filing, as the case may be. This "mounting" of a repaired part is done
best by playing it in conjunction with one preceding and one following
measure; then put two measures on each side, three, four, etc., until
you feel your ground safely under your fingers. Not until then have you
achieved your purpose of technical practice. The mere mastering of a
difficulty <i>per se</i> is no guarantee of success whatever. Many students
play certain compositions for years, and yet when they are asked to play
them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page27" id="Page27">Pg 27</a></span>
evidences of imperfection are so palpable that they
cannot have finished the learning of them. The strong probability is
that they never will finish the "study" of them, because they do not
study right.</p>

<p><i>As to the Number of Pieces</i>: The larger the number of good compositions
you are able to play in a finished manner, the better grow your
opportunities to develop your versatility of style; for in almost every
good composition you will find some traits peculiar to itself only which
demand an equally special treatment. To keep as many pieces as possible
in your memory and in good technical condition, play them a few times
each week. Do not play them, however, in consecutive repetitions. Take
one after the other. After the last piece is played the first one will
appear fresh again to your mind. This process I have tested and found
very helpful in maintaining a large repertory.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_2" id="image_2"><img src="images/jpg0002a.jpg" alt="The Position of the Hand"/></a></div>

<p><i>Play Always with the Fingers</i>&mdash;that is, move your arms as little
as possible and hold them&mdash;and the shoulder muscles&mdash;quite
loosely. The hands should be nearly horizontal, with a slight
inclination from the elbows toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page28" id="Page28">Pg 28</a></span>
keys. Bend the fingers
gently and endeavour to touch the keys in their centre and with the tips
of the fingers. This will tend toward sureness and give eyes to your
fingers, so to speak.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_3" id="image_3"><img src="images/jpg0003a.jpg" alt="Incorrect Way to Play an Octave, Correct Way to Play an Octave"/></a></div>

<p><i>The Practice of Finger Octaves</i>: Play octaves first as if you were
playing single notes with one finger of each hand. Lift the thumb and
fifth finger rather high and let them fall upon the keys without using
the wrist. Later let the wrist come to your aid, sometimes even the arm
and shoulder muscles, though the latter should both be reserved for
places requiring great power.</p>

<p>Where powerful octaves occur in long continuation it is best to
distribute the work over the joints and muscles of the fingers, wrists,
and shoulders. With a rational distribution each of the joints will
avoid over-fatigue and the player will gain in endurance. This applies,
of course, only to bravura passages. In places where musical
characteristics predominate the player does best to choose whichever of
these sources of touch seems most appropriate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page29" id="Page29">Pg 29</a></span>
</p>

<p><i>About Using the Pedal</i>: Beware of too frequent and&mdash;above
all&mdash;of long-continued use of the pedal. It is the mortal enemy of
clarity. Judiciously, however, you should use it when you study a new
work, for if you accustom yourself to play a work without the pedal the
habit of non-pedalling will grow upon you, and you will be surprised to
find later how your feet can be in the way of your fingers. Do not delay
the use of the pedal as if it were the dessert after a repast.</p>

<p><i>Never Play with a Metronome</i>: You may use a metronome for a little
passage as a test of your ability to play the passage in strict time.
When you see the result, positive or negative, stop the machine at once.
For according to the metronome a really musical rhythm is
unrhythmical&mdash;and, on the other hand, the keeping of absolutely
strict time is thoroughly unmusical and deadlike.</p>

<p>You should endeavour to reproduce the sum-total of the time which a
musical thought occupies. Within its scope, however, you must vary your
beats in accordance with their musical significance. This constitutes in
musical interpretation what I call the individual pulse-beat which
imparts life to the dead, black notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page30" id="Page30">Pg 30</a></span> Beware, however, of being
too "individual"! Avoid exaggeration, or else your patient will grow
feverish and all &#xe6;sthetic interpretation goes to the happy hunting
grounds!</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_4" id="image_4"><img src="images/jpg0004a.jpg" alt="Incorrect Position of Little Finger, Correct Position of Little Finger"/></a></div>

<p><i>The Correct Posture at the Piano</i>: Sit straight before the piano but
not stiff. Have both feet upon the pedals, so as to be at any moment
ready to use them. All other manners to keep the feet are&mdash;bad
manners. Let your hand fall with the arm upon the keyboard when you
start a phrase, and observe a certain roundness in all the motions of
your arms and hands. Avoid angles and sharp bends, for they produce
strong frictions in the joints, which means a waste of force and is
bound to cause premature fatigue.</p>

<p><i>Do Not Attend Poor Concerts.</i> Do not believe that you can learn correct
vision from the blind, nor that you can really profit by hearing how a
piece should <i>not</i> be played, and then trying the reverse. The danger of
getting accustomed to poor playing is very great. What would you think
of a parent who deliberately sent his child into bad company in order
that such child should learn how <i>not</i> to behave?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page31" id="Page31">Pg 31</a></span> Such
experiments are dangerous. By attending poor concerts you encourage the
bungler to continue in his crimes against good taste and artistic
decency, and you become his accomplice. Besides, you help to lower the
standard of appreciation in your community, which may sink so low that
good concerts will cease to be patronised. If you desire that good
concerts should be given in your city the least you can do is to
withhold your patronage from bad ones. If you are doubtful as to the
merits of a proposed concert ask your own or your children's music
teacher. He will appreciate your confidence and be glad of the
opportunity to serve you for once in a musical matter that lies on a
higher plane than your own or your children's music lesson.</p>

<p><i>To Those Who Play in Public</i> I should like to say this: Before you have
played a composition in public two or three times you must not expect
that every detail of it shall go according to your wishes. Do not be
surprised at little unexpected occurrences. Consider that the acoustic
properties of the various halls constitute a serious danger to the
musician. Bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page32" id="Page32">Pg 32</a></span>
humor on your part, or a slight indisposition,
even a clamlike audience, Puritanically austere or cool from
diffidence&mdash;all these things can be overcome; but the acoustic
properties remain the same from the beginning of your programme to its
end, and if they are not a kindly counsellor they turn into a fiendish
demon who sneers to death your every effort to produce noble-toned
pictures. Therefore, try to ascertain, as early as possible, what sort
of an architectural stomach your musical feast is to fill, and
then&mdash;well, do the best you can. Approach the picture you hold in
your mind as nearly as circumstances permit.</p>

<p><i>When I Find Bad Acoustics in a Hall.</i> An important medium of rectifying
the acoustic misbehaviour of a hall I have found in the pedal. In some
halls my piano has sounded as if I had planted my feet on the pedal for
good and ever; in such cases I practised the greatest abstention from
pedalling. It is a fact that we have to treat the pedal differently in
almost every hall to insure the same results. I know that a number of
books have been written on the use of the pedal, but they are theories
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page33" id="Page33">Pg 33</a></span>
tumble down before the first adverse experience on the
legitimate concert stage. There you can lean on nothing but experience.</p>

<p><i>About Reading Books on Music.</i> And speaking of books on music, let me
advise you to read them, but not to believe them unless they support
every statement with an argument, and unless this argument succeeds in
convincing you. In art we deal far oftener with exceptions than with
rules and laws. Every genius in art has demonstrated in his works the
forefeeling of new laws, and every succeeding one has done by his
precursors as his successors have in their turn done by him. Hence all
theorising in art must be problematic and precarious, while dogmatising
in art amounts to absurdity. Music is a language&mdash;the language of
the musical, whatever and wherever be their country. Let each one, then,
speak in his own way, as he thinks and feels, provided he is sincere.
Tolstoi put the whole thing so well when he said: "There are only three
things of real importance in the world. They are: Sincerity! Sincerity!
Sincerity!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page34" id="Page34">Pg 34</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CORRECT_TOUCH_AND_TECHNIC" id="CORRECT_TOUCH_AND_TECHNIC"></a>CORRECT TOUCH AND TECHNIC</h3>

<p>Great finger technic may be defined as extreme precision and great speed
in the action of the fingers. The latter quality, however, can never be
developed without the legato touch. I am convinced that the degree of
perfection of finger technic is exactly proportionate to the development
of the legato touch. The process of the non-legato touch, by showing
contrary results, will bear me out. To play a rapid run non-legato will
consume much more time than to play it legato because of the lifting of
the fingers between the tones. In playing legato the fingers are not
lifted off the keys, but&mdash;hardly losing contact with the
ivory&mdash;glide sideways to the right or the left as the notes may
call for it. This, naturally, saves both time and exertion, and thus
allows an increase of speed.</p>

<p>How is the true legato accomplished? By the gliding motion just
mentioned, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page35" id="Page35">Pg 35</a></span>
touching the next following key before the
finger which played last has fully abandoned its key. To illustrate, let
me say that in a run of single notes two fingers are simultaneously at
work&mdash;the "played" and the "playing" one; in runs of double notes
(thirds, sixths, etc.) the number of simultaneously employed fingers is,
analogously, four. Only in this manner is a true legato touch to be
attained. While the fingers are in action the hand must not move lest it
produce gaps between the succeeding tones, causing not only a breaking
of the connection between them but also a lessening of speed. The
transfer of the hand should take place only when the finger is already
in touch with the key that is to follow&mdash;not at the time of
contact, still less before.</p>

<p>The selection of a practical fingering is, of course, of paramount
importance for a good legato touch. In attempting a run without a good
fingering we will soon find ourselves "out of fingers." In that
emergency we should have to resort to "piecing on," and this means a
jerk at every instance&mdash;equal to a non-legato. A correct fingering
is one which permits the longest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page36" id="Page36">Pg 36</a></span>
natural sequel of fingers to be
used without a break. By earnest thinking every player can contrive the
fingering that will prove most convenient to him. But, admitting that
the great diversity of hands prohibits a universal fingering, all the
varieties of fingering ought to be based upon the principle of a natural
sequel. If a player be puzzled by certain configurations of notes and
keys as to the best fingering for them, he ought to consult a teacher,
who, if a good one, will gladly help him out.</p>

<p>Precision, the other component part of finger technic, is intimately
related with the player's general sense of orderliness. As a matter of
fact, precision is orderliness in the technical execution of a musical
prescription. If the student will but look quite closely at the piece he
is learning; if he has the patience to repeat a difficult place in it a
hundred times if necessary&mdash;and correctly, of course&mdash;he will
soon acquire the trait of precision and he will experience the resultant
increase in his technical ability.</p>

<p>Mental technic presupposes the ability to form a clear inward conception
of a run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page37" id="Page37">Pg 37</a></span>
without resorting to the fingers at all. Since every
action of a finger has first to be determined upon by the mind, a run
should be completely prepared mentally before it is tried on the piano.
In other words, the student should strive to acquire the ability to form
the tonal picture in his mind, rather than the note picture.</p>

<p>The tonal picture dwells in our imagination. This acts upon the
responsive portions of the brain, influences them according to its own
intensity, and this influence is then transferred to the motoric
nerve-centres which are concerned in music-making. As far as known this
is the course by which the musician converts his musical concept into a
tonal reality. Hence, when studying a new work, it is imperative that a
tonal picture of perfect clarity should be prepared in the mind before
the mechanical (or technical) practicing begins. In the earlier stages
of cultivating this trait it will be best to ask the teacher to play the
piece for us, and thus to help us in forming a correct tonal picture in
our mind.</p>

<p>The blurring of the tonal picture produces a temporary (don't get
frightened!) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page38" id="Page38">Pg 38</a></span>
paralysis of the motoric centres which control the
fingers. Every pianist knows&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;the sensation of
having his fingers begin to "stick" as if the keys were covered with
flypaper, and he knows, also, that this sensation is but a warning that
the fingers are going on a general and even "sympathetic"
strike&mdash;sympathetic, because even the momentarily unconcerned
fingers participate in it. Now the cause of this sensation lies not in a
defective action of the fingers themselves, but solely in the mind. It
is there that some undesired change has taken place, a change which
impairs the action of the fingers. The process is like this: by quick
repetitions of complicated figures, slight errors, slips, flaws escape
our notice; the more quick repetitions we make the larger will be the
number of these tiny blots, and this must needs lead finally to a
completely distorted tonal picture. This distortion, however, is not the
worst feature. Inasmuch as we are very likely not to make the same
little blunders at every repetition the tonal picture becomes confused,
blurred. The nerve contacts which cause the fingers to act become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page39" id="Page39">Pg 39</a></span>
undecided first, then they begin to fail more and more, until
they cease altogether and the fingers&mdash;stick! At such a juncture
the student should at once resort to slow practice. He should play the
defective place clearly, orderly, and, above all, slowly, and persist in
this course until the number of correct repetitions proves sufficient to
crowd the confused tonal picture out of the mind. This is not to be
regarded as mechanical practice, for it is intended for the
rehabilitation of a disarranged or disturbed mental concept. I trust
this will speak for the practice of what I called "mental technic." Make
the mental tonal picture sharp; the fingers must and will obey it.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_5" id="image_5"><img src="images/jpg0005a.jpg" alt="Incorrect Position of Thumb, Correct Position of Thumb"/></a></div>

<p>We are sometimes affected by "thought-laziness"&mdash;I translate this
word literally from other languages, because it is a good compound for
which I can find no better equivalent in English. Whenever we find the
fingers going astray in the piece we play we might as well admit to
ourselves that the trouble is in the main office. The mysterious
controlling officer has been talking with a friend instead of attending
to business. The mind was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page40" id="Page40">Pg 40</a></span>
keeping step with the fingers. We
have relied on our automatism; we allowed the fingers to run on and the
mind lagged behind, instead of being, as it should be, ahead of the
fingers, preparing their work.</p>

<p>Quick musical thinking, the importance of which is thus apparent, cannot
be developed by any direct course. It is one of the by-products of the
general widening of one's musical horizon. It is ever proportionate to
the growth of one's other musical faculties. It is the result of
elasticity of the mind acquired or developed by constant, never-failing,
unremitting employment whenever we are at the piano. A procedure tending
directly toward developing quick musical thinking is, therefore, not
necessary.</p>

<p>The musical will has its roots in the natural craving for musical
utterance. It is the director-in-chief of all that is musical in us.
Hence I recognise in the purely technical processes of piano-playing no
less a manifestation of the musical will. But a technic without a
musical will is a faculty without a purpose, and when it becomes a
purpose in itself it can never serve art.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page41" id="Page41">Pg 41</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_USE_OF_THE_PEDAL" id="THE_USE_OF_THE_PEDAL"></a>THE USE OF THE PEDAL</h3>

<p>To speak in a concrete manner of the pedal is possible only on the basis
of a complete understanding of the fundamental principle underlying its
use. The reader must agree to the governing theory that the organ which
governs the employment of the pedal is&mdash;the ear! As the eye guides
the fingers when we read music, so must the ear be the guide&mdash;and
the "sole" guide&mdash;of the foot upon the pedal. The foot is merely
the servant, the executive agent, while the ear is the guide, the judge,
and the final criterion. If there is any phase in piano-playing where we
should remember particularly that music is for the ear it is in the
treatment of the pedal. Hence, whatever is said here in the following
lines with regard to the pedal must be understood as resting upon the
basis of this principle.</p>

<p>As a general rule I recommend pressing the lever or treadle down with a
quick, definite, full motion and always immediately after&mdash;mark me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page42" id="Page42">Pg 42</a></span>after&mdash;the
striking of the keys, never simultaneously with the stroke of the
fingers, as so many erroneously assume and do. To prevent a cacophonous
mixture of tones we should consider that we must stop the old tone
before we can give pedal to the new one, and that, in order to make the
stopping of the past tone perfect, we must allow the damper to press
upon the vibrating strings long enough to do its work. If, however, we
tread down exactly with the finger-stroke we simply inhibit this
stopping, because the damper in question is lifted again before it has
had time to fall down. (In speaking of the dampers as moving up and down
I have in mind the action of the "grand" piano; in the upright piano the
word "off" must be substituted for "up," and "on" for "down.") This rule
will work in a vast majority of cases, but like every
rule&mdash;especially in art&mdash;it will be found to admit of many
exceptions.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_6" id="image_6"><img src="images/jpg0006a.jpg" alt="Incorrect Position of the Feet"/></a></div>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_7" id="image_7"><img src="images/jpg0007a.jpg" alt="Correct Position of the Feet on the Pedal"/></a></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page43" id="Page43">Pg 43</a></span>

<i>Harmonic Clarity in Pedalling is the Basis</i>, but it is only the basis;
it is not all that constitutes an artistic treatment of the pedal. In
spite of what I have just said above there are in many pieces moments
where a blending of tones, seemingly foreign to one another, is a means
of characterisation. This blending is especially permissible when the
passing (foreign) tones are more than one octave removed from the lowest
tone and from the harmony built upon it. In this connection it should be
remembered that the pedal is not merely a means of tone prolongation but
also a means of colouring&mdash;and pre-eminently that. What is
generally understood by the term piano-charm is to the greatest extent
produced by an artistic use of the pedal.</p>

<p>For instance, great accent effects can be produced by the gradual
accumulating of tone-volume through the pedal and its sudden release on
the accented point. The effect is somewhat like that which we hear in
the orchestra when a crescendo is supported by a roll of the drum or
tympani making the last tap on the accented point. And, as I am
mentioning the orchestra, I may illustrate by the French horns another
use of the pedal: where the horns do not carry the melody (which they do
relatively seldom) they are employed to support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page44" id="Page44">Pg 44</a></span>sustained
harmonies, and their effect is like a glazing, a binding, a unifying of
the various tone-colours of the other instruments. Just such a glazing
is produced by the judicious use of the pedal, and when, in the
orchestra, the horns cease and the strings proceed alone there ensues a
certain soberness of tone which we produce in the piano by the release
and non-use of the pedal. In the former instance, while the horns were
active they furnished the harmonic background upon which the thematic
development of the musical picture proceeded; in the latter case, when
the horns cease the background is taken away and the thematic
configurations stand out&mdash;so to speak&mdash;against the sky. Hence,
the pedal gives to the piano tone that unifying, glazing, that
finish&mdash;though this is not exactly the word here&mdash;which the
horns or softly played trombones give to the orchestra.</p>

<p><i>But the Pedal Can Do More Than That.</i> At times we can produce strange,
glasslike effects by purposely mixing non-harmonic tones. I only need to
hint at some of the fine, embroidery-like cadenzas in Chopin's works,
like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page45" id="Page45">Pg 45</a></span>
one in his E-minor Concerto (Andante, measures 101,
102, and 103). Such blendings are productive of a multitude of effects,
especially when we add the agency of dynamic gradation: effects
suggestive of winds from Zephyr to Boreas, of the splash and roar of
waves, of fountain-play, of rustling leaves, etc. This mode of blending
can be extended also to entire harmonies in many cases where one
fundamental chord is to predominate for some time while other chords may
pass in quicker succession while it lasts. In such cases it is by no
means imperative to abandon the pedal; we need only to establish various
dynamic levels and place the ruling harmony on a higher level than the
passing ones. In other words, the predominating chord must receive so
much force that it can outlast all those briefer ones which, though
audible, must die of their own weakness, and while the strong, ruling
chord was constantly disturbed by the weaker ones it also re-established
its supremacy with the death of every weaker one which it outlasted.
This use of the pedal has its limitations in the evanescent nature of
the tone of the piano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page46" id="Page46">Pg 46</a></span>
That moment when the blending of
non-harmonic tones imperils the tonal beauty of the piece in hand can be
determined solely and exclusively by the player's own ear, and here we
are once more at the point from which this article started, namely: that
the ear is governor, and that it alone can decide whether or not there
is to be any pedal.</p>

<p>It were absurd to assume that we can greatly please the ear of others by
our playing so long as our own ear is not completely satisfied. We
should, therefore, endeavour to train the susceptibility of our ear, and
we should ever make it more difficult to gain the assent of our own ear
than to gain that of our auditors. They may, apparently, not notice
defects in your playing, but at this juncture I wish to say a word of
serious warning: Do not confound unmindfulness with consent! To hear
ourselves play&mdash;that is, to listen to our own playing&mdash;is the
bed-rock basis of all music-making and also, of course, of the technic
of the pedal. Therefore, listen carefully, attentively to the tones you
produce. When you employ the pedal as a prolongation of the fingers (to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page47" id="Page47">Pg 47</a></span>
sustain tones beyond the reach of the fingers), see to it that
you catch, and hold, the fundamental tone of your chord, for this tone
must be always your chief consideration.</p>

<p><i>Whether You Use the Pedal as a Means of Mere Prolongation</i> or as a
medium of colouring, under no circumstances use it as a cloak for
imperfection of execution. For, like charity, it is apt to be made to
cover a multitude of sins; but, again like charity, who wants to make
himself dependent upon it, when honest work can prevent it?</p>

<p>Nor should the pedal be used to make up for a deficiency of force. To
produce a forte is the business of the fingers (with or without the aid
of the arm) but not of the pedal, and this holds true
also&mdash;<i>mutatis mutandis</i>&mdash;of the left pedal, for which the
Germans use a word (<i>Verschiebung</i>) denoting something like "shifting."
In a "grand" piano the treading of the left pedal shifts the hammers so
far to one side that instead of striking three strings they will strike
only two. (In the pianos of fifty and more years ago there were only two
strings to each tone, and when the hammers were shifted by<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page48" id="Page48">Pg 48</a></span> the treading of the left pedal they
struck only one string. From those days we have retained the term "<i>una
corda</i>"&mdash;one string.) In an upright piano the lessening of
tone-volume is produced by a lessening of the momentum of the hammer
stroke.</p>

<p>Now, as the right pedal should not be used to cover a lack of force, so
should the left pedal not be regarded as a licence to neglect the
formation of a fine <i>pianissimo</i> touch. It should not cloak or screen a
defective <i>pianissimo</i>, but should serve exclusively as a means of
colouring where the softness of tone is coupled with what the jewellers
call "dull finish." For the left pedal does not soften the tone without
changing its character; it lessens the quantity of tone but at the same
time it also markedly affects the quality.</p>

<p>To <i>Sum Up</i>: Train your ear and then use both pedals honestly! Use them
for what they were made. Remember that even screens are not used for
hiding things behind them, but for decorative purposes or for
protection. Those who do use them for hiding something must have
something which they prefer to hide!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page49" id="Page49">Pg 49</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="PLAYING_IN_STYLE" id="PLAYING_IN_STYLE"></a>PLAYING "IN STYLE"</h3>

<p>By playing a piece of music "in style" is understood a rendition which
does absolute justice to its contents in regard to the manner of
expression. Now, the true manner of expression must be sought and found
for each piece individually, even though a number of different pieces
may be written by one and the same composer. Our first endeavour should
be to search out the peculiarity of the piece in hand rather than that
of the composer in general. If you have succeeded in playing one work by
Chopin in style, it does not follow, by any means, that you can play
equally well any other work from his pen. Though on general lines his
manner of writing may be the same in all his works, there will,
nevertheless, be marked differences between the various pieces.</p>

<p>Only by careful study of each work by itself can we find the key to its
correct conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page50" id="Page50">Pg 50</a></span>
and rendition. We will never find it in books
about the composer, nor in such as treat of his works, but only in the
works themselves and in each one <i>per se</i>. People who study a lot of
things about a work of art may possibly enrich their general knowledge,
but they never can get that specific knowledge needful for the
interpretation of the particular work in hand. Its own contents alone
can furnish that knowledge. We know from frequent experience that
book-learned musicians (or, as they are now called, musicologists)
usually read everything in sight, and yet their playing rises hardly
ever above mediocre dilettanteism.</p>

<p>Why should we look for a correct conception of a piece anywhere but in
the piece itself? Surely the composer has embodied in the piece all he
knew and felt when he wrote it. Why, then, not listen to his specific
language instead of losing our way in the terms of another art?
Literature is literature, and music is music. They may combine, as in
song, but one can never be substituted for the other.</p>

<p><i>Many Students Never Learn</i> to understand a composer's specific language
because their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page51" id="Page51">Pg 51</a></span>
sole concern is to make the piece "effective" in
the sense of a clever stunt. This tendency is most deplorable; for there
really does exist a specifically musical language. By purely material
means: through notes, pauses, dynamic and other signs, through special
annotations, etc., the composer encloses in his work the whole world of
his imagination. The duty of the interpretative artist is to extract
from these material things the spiritual essence and to transmit it to
his hearers. To achieve this he must understand this musical language in
general and of each composition in particular.</p>

<p>But&mdash;how is this language to be learned?</p>

<p>By conning with careful attentiveness&mdash;and, of course,
absorbing&mdash;the purely material matter of a piece: the notes,
pauses, time values, dynamic indications, etc.</p>

<p>If a player be scrupulously exact in his mere reading of a piece it
will, of itself, lead him to understand a goodly portion of the piece's
specific language. Nay, more! Through a really correct conning the
player is enabled to determine upon the points of repose as well as upon
the matter of climax, and thus to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page52" id="Page52">Pg 52</a></span>
create a basis for the
operations of his own imagination. After that, nothing remains but to
call forth into tonal life, through the fingers, what his musical
intelligence has grasped&mdash;which is a purely technical task. To
transform the purely technical and material processes into a thing that
lives, of course, rests with the natural, emotional, temperamental
endowments of the individual; it rests with those many and complex
qualities which are usually summarised by the term "talent," but this
must be presupposed with a player who aspires to artistic work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, talent alone cannot lift the veil that hides the
spiritual content of a composition if its possessor neglects to examine
the latter carefully as to its purely material ingredients. He may
flatter the ear, sensuously speaking, but he can never play the piece in
style.</p>

<p><i>Now How Can We Know</i> whether we are or are not approaching the
spiritual phase of a piece? By repetition under unremitting attention to
the written values. If, then, you should find how much there is still
left for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page53" id="Page53">Pg 53</a></span>
to do, you have proved to yourself that you have
understood the piece spiritually and are on the right track to master
it. With every repetition you will discover some hitherto unnoticed
defect in your interpretation. Obviate these defects, one by one, and in
so doing you will come nearer and nearer to the spiritual essence of the
work in hand.</p>

<p>As to the remaining "purely technical task" (as I said before), it must
not be underestimated! To transmit one's matured conception to one's
auditors requires a considerable degree of mechanical skill, and this
skill, in its turn, must be under absolute control of the will. Of
course&mdash;after the foregoing&mdash;this does not mean that everybody
who has a good and well-controlled technic can interpret a piece in
style. Remember that to possess wealth is one thing, to put it to good
use is quite another.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that the too objective study of a piece may impair
the "individuality" of its rendition. Have no fear of that! If ten
players study the same piece with the same high degree of exactness and
objectivity&mdash;depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page54" id="Page54">Pg 54</a></span>
upon it: each one will still play it
quite differently from the nine others, though each one may think his
rendition the only correct one. For each one will express what,
according to his lights, he has mentally and temperamentally absorbed.
Of the distinctive feature which constitutes the difference in the ten
conceptions each one will have been unconscious while it formed itself,
and perhaps also afterward. But it is just this unconsciously formed
feature which constitutes legitimate individuality and which alone will
admit of a real fusion of the composer's and the interpreter's thought.
A purposed, blatant parading of the player's dear self through wilful
additions of nuances, shadings, effects, and what not, is tantamount to
a falsification; at best it is "playing to the galleries," charlatanism.
The player should always feel convinced that he plays only what is
written. To the auditor, who with his own and different intelligence
follows the player's performance, the piece will appear in the light of
the player's individuality. The stronger this is the more it will colour
the performance, when unconsciously admixed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page55" id="Page55">Pg 55</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rubinstein Often Said to Me</i>: "Just play first exactly what is written;
if you have done full justice to it and then still feel like adding or
changing anything, why, do so." Mind well: after you have done full
justice to what is written! How few are those who fulfil this duty! I
venture to prove to any one who will play for me&mdash;if he be at all
worth listening to&mdash;that he does not play more than is written (as
he may think), but, in fact, a good deal less than the printed page
reveals. And this is one of the principal causes of misunderstanding the
esoteric portion, the inherent "style" of a piece&mdash;a
misunderstanding which is not always confined to amateurs&mdash;inexact
reading!</p>

<p>The true interpretation of a piece of music results from a correct
understanding of it, and this, in turn, depends solely upon scrupulously
exact reading.</p>

<p><i>Learn the Language of Music</i>, then, I repeat, through exact reading!
You will then soon fathom the musical meaning of a composition and
transmit it intelligibly to your listeners. Would you satisfy your
curiosity as to what manner of person the author is or was at<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page56" id="Page56">Pg 56</a></span> the time of writing, you may do so.
But&mdash;as I said in the "Foreword"&mdash;your chief interest should
centre in the "composition," not in the "composer," for only by studying
his work will you be enabled to play it in style.

<h3><a name="HOW_RUBINSTEIN_TAUGHT" id="HOW_RUBINSTEIN_TAUGHT"></a>HOW RUBINSTEIN TAUGHT ME TO PLAY</h3>

<p>Outside of the regular students of the Imperial Conservatory of Music at
St. Petersburg, Rubinstein accepted but one pupil. The advantage and
privilege to be that one pupil was mine.</p>

<p>I came to Rubinstein when I was sixteen years old and left him at
eighteen. Since that time I have studied only by myself; for to whom
could I have gone after Rubinstein? His very manner of teaching was such
that it would have made any other teacher appear to me like a
schoolmaster. He chose the method of indirect instruction through
suggestive comparisons. He touched upon the strictly musical only upon
rare occasions. In this way he wished to awaken within me the concretely
musical as a parallel of his generalisations and thereby preserve my
musical individuality.</p>

<p>He never played for me. He only talked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page58" id="Page58">Pg 58</a></span> and I, understanding
him, translated his meaning into music and musical utterances.
Sometimes, for instance, when I played the same phrase twice in
succession, and played it both times alike (say in a sequence), he would
say: "In fine weather you may play it as you did, but when it rains play
it differently."</p>

<p>Rubinstein was much given to whims and moods, and he often grew
enthusiastic about a certain conception only to prefer a different one
the next day. Yet he was always logical in his art, and though he aimed
at hitting the nail from various points of view he always hit it on the
head. Thus he never permitted me to bring to him, as a lesson, any
composition more than once. He explained this to me once by saying that
he might forget in the next lesson what he told me in the previous one,
and by drawing an entirely new picture only confuse my mind. Nor did he
ever permit me to bring one of his own works, though he never explained
to me his reason for this singular attitude.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_9" id="image_9"><img src="images/jpg0009a.jpg" alt="How Rubinstein Taught Me to Play"/></a></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page59" id="Page59">Pg 59</a></span>

Usually, when I came to him, arriving from Berlin, where I lived, I
found him seated at his writing-desk, smoking Russian cigarettes. He
lived at the H&#xf4;tel de l'Europe. After a kindly salute he would always
ask me the same question: "Well, what is new in the world?"</p>

<p>I remember replying to him: "I know nothing new; that's why I came to
learn something new&mdash;from you."</p>

<p>Rubinstein, understanding at once the musical meaning of my words,
smiled, and the lesson thus promised to be a fine one.</p>

<p>I noticed he was usually not alone when I came, but had as visitors
several elderly ladies, sometimes very old ladies (mostly Russians), and
some young girls&mdash;seldom any men. With a wave of his hand he
directed me to the piano in the corner, a Bechstein, which was most of
the time shockingly out of tune; but to this condition of his piano he
was always serenely indifferent. He would remain at his desk studying
the notes of the work while I played. He always compelled me to bring
the pieces along, insisting that I should play everything just as it was
written! He would follow every note of my playing with his eyes riveted
on the printed pages. A pedant he certainly was, a stickler for<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page60" id="Page60">Pg 60</a></span> the letter&mdash;incredibly so,
especially when one considered the liberties he took when he played the
same works! Once I called his attention modestly to this seeming
paradox, and he answered: "When you are as old as I am now you may do as
I do&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>Once I played a Liszt Rhapsody pretty badly. After a few moments he
said: "The way you played this piece would be all right for auntie or
mamma." Then rising and coming toward me he would say: "Now let us see
how we play such things." Then I would begin all over again, but hardly
had I played a few measures when he would interrupt and say: "Did you
start? I thought I hadn't heard right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, master, I certainly did," I would reply.</p>

<p>"Oh," he would say vaguely. "I didn't notice."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" I would ask.</p>

<p>"I mean this," he would answer: "Before your fingers touch the keys you
must begin the piece mentally&mdash;that is, you must have settled in
your mind the <i>tempo</i>, the manner of touch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page61" id="Page61">Pg 61</a></span> and, above all, the
attack of the first notes, before your actual playing begins. And
by-the-bye, what is the character of this piece? Is it dramatic, tragic,
lyric, romantic, humourous, heroic, sublime, mystic&mdash;what? Well,
why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>Generally I would mutter something after such a tirade, but usually I
said something stupid because of the awe with which he inspired me.
Finally, after trying several of his suggested designations I would hit
it right. Then he would say: "Well, there we are at last! Humourous, is
it? Very well! And rhapsodical, irregular&mdash;hey? You understand the
meaning?" I would answer, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," he would reply; "now prove it." And then I would
begin all over again.</p>

<p>He would stand at my side, and whenever he wanted a special stress laid
upon a certain note his powerful fingers would press upon my left
shoulder with such force that I would stab the keys till the piano
fairly screamed for me. When this did not have the effect he was after
he would simply press his whole hand upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page62" id="Page62">Pg 62</a></span> mine, flattening it
out and spreading it like butter all over the keys, black and white
ones, creating a frightful cacophony. Then he would say, almost with
anger, "But cleaner, cleaner, cleaner," as if the discord had been of my
doing.</p>

<p>Such occurrences did not lack a humourous side, but their turn into the
tragical always hung by a hair, especially if I had tried to explain or
to make excuses. So I generally kept silent, and I found, after some
experience, that was the only proper thing for me to do. For just as
quickly as he would flare up he would also calm down again, and when the
piece was ended I would hear his usual comment: "You are an excellent
young man!" And how quickly was all pain then forgotten!</p>

<p>I remember on one occasion that I played Schubert-Liszt's "Erl-K&#xf6;nig."
When I came to the place in the composition where the Erl-King says to
the child, "Thou dear, sweet child, oh, come with me," and I had played
several false notes besides very poor arpeggios, Rubinstein asked me:
"Do you know the text at this place?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page63" id="Page63">Pg 63</a></span></p>

<p>As a reply I quoted the words.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," he said, "the Erl-King addresses the child; Erl-King
is a spirit, a ghost&mdash;so play this place in a spiritlike way,
ghostly, if you will, but not ghastly with false notes!"</p>

<p>I had to laugh at his word-play and Rubinstein himself chimed in, and
the piece was saved, or rather the player. For when I repeated that
particular part it went very well, and he allowed me to continue without
further interruption.</p>

<p>Once I asked him for the fingering of a rather complex passage.</p>

<p>"Play it with your nose," he replied, "but make it sound well!"</p>

<p>This remark puzzled me, and there I sat and wondered what he meant.</p>

<p>As I understand it now he meant: Help yourself! The Lord helps those who
help themselves!</p>


<p>As I said before, Rubinstein never played for me the works I had to
study. He explained, analysed, elucidated everything that he wanted me
to know; but, this done, he left me to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page64" id="Page64">Pg 64</a></span> own judgment, for only
then, he would explain, would my achievement be my own and incontestable
property. I learned from Rubinstein in this way the valuable truth that
the conception of tone-pictures obtained through the playing of another
gives us only transient impressions; they come and go, while the
self-created conception will last and remain our own.</p>

<p>Now, when I look back upon my study-days with Rubinstein, I can see that
he did not so much instruct me as that I learned from him. He was not a
pedagogue in the usual meaning of that word. He indicated to me an
altitude offering a fine view, but how I was to get up there was my
affair; he did not bother about it. "Play with your nose!" Yes&mdash;but
when I bumped it till it fairly bled where would I get the metaphorical
handkerchief? In my imagination! And he was right.</p>

<p>To be sure, this method would not work with all pupils, but it is
nevertheless well calculated to develop a student's original thought and
bring out whatever acumen he may possess. If such a one succeeded by his
own study and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page65" id="Page65">Pg 65</a></span>
mental force to reach the desired point which the
great magician's wizardry had made him see, he had gained the reliance
in his own strength: he felt sure that he would always find that point
again&mdash;even though he should lose his way once or twice, as every
one with an honest aspiration is liable to do.</p>

<p>I recall that Rubinstein once said to me: "Do you know why piano-playing
is so difficult? Because it is prone to be either affected or else
afflicted with mannerisms; and when these two pitfalls are luckily
avoided then it is liable to be&mdash;dry! The truth lies between those
three mischiefs!"</p>

<p>When it was settled that I should make my Hamburg d&#xe9;but under his baton
with his own D-minor Concerto, I thought the time had come at last to
study with him one of his own works. So I proposed it, but Rubinstein
disposed of it! I still see him, as if it were but yesterday, seated in
the greenroom of the Berlin Philharmonic during an intermission in his
concert (it was on a Saturday) and telling me: "We shall appear together
in Hamburg on Monday." The time was short, but I knew the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page66" id="Page66">Pg 66</a></span> Concerto and hoped to go through it
with him some time in the remaining two days. I asked his permission to
play the Concerto for him, but he declined my urgent request, saying:
"It is not necessary; we understand each other!" And even in this
critical moment he left me to my own resources. After the last (and
only) rehearsal the great master embraced me before the whole orchestra,
and I&mdash;well, I was not in the seventh, but in the "eighth" heaven!
Everything was all right, I said to myself, for Rubinstein, Rubinstein
was satisfied! The public simply had to be! The concert went off
splendidly.</p>

<p>After that memorable d&#xe9;but in Hamburg, which was on March 14, 1894, I
went directly to see Rubinstein, little dreaming that my eyes would then
see him for the last time. I brought with me a large photograph of
himself, and, though fully aware of his unconquerable aversion to
autographing, my desire for the possession of his signature overruled my
reluctance and I made my request.</p>

<p>He raised both fists and thundered, half-angry and half-laughing: "<i>Et
tu, Brute?</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page67" id="Page67">Pg 67</a></span></p>

<p>But my wish was granted, and I reproduce the portrait in this article.</p>

<p>Then I asked him when I should play for him again, and to my
consternation he answered: "Never!"</p>

<p>In my despair I asked him: "Why not?"</p>

<p>He, generous soul that he was, then said to me: "My dear boy, I have
told you all I know about legitimate piano-playing and
music-making"&mdash;and then changing his tone somewhat he added: "And
if you don't know it <i>yet</i>, why, go to the devil!"</p>

<p>I saw only too well that while he smiled as he said it he meant it
seriously, and I left him.</p>

<p>I never saw Rubinstein again. Soon after that he returned to his villa
in Peterhof, near St. Petersburg, and there he died on November 19,
1894.</p>

<p>The effect that his death had upon me I shall never forget. The world
appeared suddenly entirely empty to me, devoid of any interest. My grief
made me realise how my heart had worshipped not only the artist in him
but also the man; how I loved him as if he were my father. I learned of
his death through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page68" id="Page68">Pg 68</a></span>
English papers while I was <i>en route</i> from
London to Cheltenham, where I was booked for a recital on the twentieth.
The B-flat minor Sonata by Chopin happened to be on the programme, and
as I struck the first notes of the Funeral March the whole audience rose
from their seats as if by command and remained standing with bowed heads
during the whole piece&mdash;in honour of the great departed.</p>

<p>A singular coincidence occurred at my concert on the preceding
day&mdash;the day of Rubinstein's death.</p>

<p>On this day I played for the first time in public after my seven years'
retirement (excepting my Hamburg d&#xe9;but). It was in London. In this
concert I played, as a novelty, a Polonaise in E-flat minor which
Rubinstein had but recently written in Dresden and dedicated to me. He
had included it in the set called "Souvenirs de Dresde." This piece has
throughout the character of a Funeral March in all but the
time-division. Little did I dream while I was playing it that day that I
was singing him into his eternal rest, for it was but a few hours later
that, in the far East of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page69" id="Page69">Pg 69</a></span>
my great master passed away, suddenly, of heart failure.</p>

<p>Two years later I played this same Polonaise for the second and last
time. It was on the anniversary of his death, in St. Petersburg, where
in honour of his memory I gave a recital, the proceeds of which I
devoted to the Rubinstein Fund. Since then I have played this piece only
once, at home and to myself, excluding it entirely from my public
r&#xe9;pertoire. For, though it was dedicated to me, the time and
circumstances of its initial performance always made me feel as if it
still belonged to my master, or, at best, as if it were something
personal and private between us two.

<h2><a name="Indispensables_in_Pianistic" id="Indispensables_in_Pianistic"></a>Indispensables in Pianistic Success</h2>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>"The Indispensables in Pianistic Success? Are not the indispensables in
all success very much the same? Nothing can take the place of real
worth. This is especially true of America, in which country I have lived
longer than in any other, and which I am glad to call my home. Americans
are probably the most traveled people of the world, and it is futile to
offer them anything but the best. Some years ago a conductor brought to
this country an orchestra of second-class character, with the idea that
the people would accept it just because it bore the name of a famous
European city which possessed one of the great orchestras of the world.
It was a good orchestra, but there were better orchestras in American
cities, and it took American audiences just two concerts to find this
out, resulting in a disastrous failure, which the conductor was man
enough to face and personally defray. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page71" id="Page71">Pg 71</a></span> American people know
the best, and will have nothing but the best. Therefore, if you would
make a list of the indispensables of pianistic success in this country
at this time you must put at the head of your list, REAL WORTH.</p>

<p>"Naturally, one of the first indispensables would include what many term
'the musical gift.' However, this is often greatly misunderstood. We
are, happily, past the time when music was regarded as a special kind of
divine dispensation, which, by its very possession, robbed the musician
of any claim to possible excellence in other lines. In other words,
music was so special a gift that it was even thought by some misguided
people to isolate the musician from the world&mdash;to make him a thing
apart and different from other men and women of high aspirations and
attainments.</p>

<p>"It is true that there have been famous prodigies in mathematics, and in
games such as chess, who have given evidence of astonishing prowess in
their chosen work, but who, at the same time, seem to have been
lamentably under-developed in many other ways. This is not the case in
music at this day at least, for, although a special love for music and a
special quickness in mastering musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page72" id="Page72">Pg 72</a></span>problems are
indispensable, yet the musicians are usually men and women of broad
cultural development if they desire it and are willing to work for it.</p>

<p>"Nor can I concede that a very finely developed sense of hearing is in
all cases essential. The possession of what is known as absolute pitch,
which so many seem to think is a sure indication of musical genius, is
often a nuisance. Schumann did not possess it, and (unless I am
incorrectly informed) Wagner did not have absolute pitch. I have it, and
can, I believe, distinguish differences of an eighth of a tone. I find
it more disturbing than beneficial. My father had absolute pitch in
remarkable fashion. He seemed to have extremely acute ears. Indeed, it
was often impossible for him to identify a well-known composition if he
heard it played in a different key&mdash;it sounded so different to him.
Mozart had absolute pitch, but music, in his day, was far less
complicated. We now live in an age of melodic and contrapuntal
intricacy, and I do not believe that the so-called acute sense of
hearing, or highly developed sense of absolute pitch, has very much to
do with one's real musical ability. The physical hearing is<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page73" id="Page73">Pg 73</a></span> nothing; the spiritual
hearing&mdash;if one may say so&mdash;is what really counts. If, in
transposing, for instance, one has associated the contents of a piece so
closely with its corresponding tonality that it is hard to play in any
other tonality, this constitutes a difficulty&mdash;not an advantage.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>"Too much cannot be said about the advantage of an early drill. The
impressions made during youth seem to be the most lasting. I am certain
that the pieces that I learned before I was ten years of age remain more
persistently in my memory than the compositions I studied after I was
thirty. The child who is destined for a musical career should receive as
much musical instruction in early life as is compatible with the child's
health and receptivity. To postpone the work too long is just as
dangerous to the child's career as it is dangerous to overload the pupil
with more work than his mind and body can absorb. Children learn far
more rapidly than adults&mdash;not merely because of the fact that the
work becomes more and more complicated as the student advances, but also
because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page74" id="Page74">Pg 74</a></span>
child mind is so vastly more receptive. The child's
power of absorption in music study between the ages of eight and twelve
is simply enormous; it is less between twelve and twenty; still less
between twenty and thirty, and often lamentably small between thirty and
forty. It might be represented by some such diagram as:</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_1b" id="image_1b"><img src="images/jpg001b.jpg" alt="Power of Absorption in Music Study, by Age"/></a></div>

<p>"Of course, these lines are only comparative, and there are exceptional
cases of astonishing development late in life, due to enormous ambition
and industry. Yet the period of highest achievement is usually early in
life. This is especially true in the arts where digital skill is
concerned.</p>

<p>"All teachers are aware of the need for the best possible drill early in
life. The idea one so often hears expressed in America: 'Since<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page75" id="Page75">Pg 75</a></span> my daughter is only beginning her
studies&mdash;any teacher will do,' has been the source of great laxity
in American musical education. If the father who has such an idea would
only transpose the same thought to the building of a house he would be
surprised to find himself saying: 'Since I am only laying a foundation,
any kind of trashy material will do. I will use inferior cement,
plaster, stone, bricks, decayed wood and cheap hardware, and employ the
cheapest labor I can procure. But when I get to the roof I shall engage
the finest roofmakers in the world!'</p>

<p>"The beginning is of such tremendous importance that only the best is
good enough. By this I do not mean the most expensive teacher
obtainable, but someone who is thorough, painstaking, conscientious,
alert and experienced. The foundation is the part of the house in which
the greatest strength and thoroughness is required. Everything must be
solid, substantial, firm and secure, to stand the stress of use and the
test of time. Of course, there is such a thing as employing a teacher
with a big reputation and exceptional skill, who would make an excellent
teacher for an advanced student, but who might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page76" id="Page76">Pg 76</a></span>incapable of
laying a good foundation for the beginner. One wants strength at the
foundation&mdash;not gold ornaments and marble trimmings and beautiful
decorations, fretwork, carving. Just as in great cities one finds firms
which make a specialty of laying foundations for immense buildings, so
it is often wise to employ a teacher who specializes in instructing
beginners. In European music schools this has almost always been the
case. It is not virtuosity that is needed in the makeup of the teacher
of beginners, but rather sound musicianship, as well as the
comprehension of the child psychology. Drill, drill, and more drill, is
the secret of the early training of the mind and hand. This is indicated
quite as much in games such as tennis, billiards and golf. Think of the
remarkable records of some very young players in these games, and you
will see what may be accomplished in the early years of the young
player.</p>

<p>"In all arts and sciences, as one advances, complications and obstacles
seem to multiply in complexity until the point of mastery is reached;
then the tendency seems to reverse itself, until a kind of circle
carries one round again to the point of simplicity. I have often liked
to picture this to myself in this way:</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_2b" id="image_2b"><img src="images/jpg002b.jpg" alt="Point of Greatest Complexity"/></a></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page77" id="Page77">Pg 77</a></span></p>

<p>"It is encouraging for the student to know that he must expect to be
confronted with ever-increasing difficulties, until he reaches the point
where all the intense and intricate problems seem to solve themselves,
dissolving gradually into the light of a clear understanding day. This
is to me a general principle underlying almost all lines of human
achievement, and it appears to me that the student should learn its
application, not only to his own but to other occupations and
attainments. This universal line of life, starting with birth, mounting
to its climax in middle life, and then passing on to greater and greater
simplicity of means, until at death the circle is almost completed, is a
kind of human program which all successful men would appear to follow.
Perhaps we can make this clearer by studying the evolution of the steam
engine.</p>

<p>"The steam engine started with the most primitive kind of apparatus. At
the very first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page78" id="Page78">Pg 78</a></span>
it was of the turbine type. Hero of Alexander
(Heron, in Greek) made the first steam engine, which was little more
than a toy. According to some historians, Heron lived in the second
century before Christ, and according to others his work was done in the
latter half of the first century. He was an ingenious mathematician who
often startled the people of this time with his mechanical contrivances.
It is difficult to show the principle of his engine in an exact drawing;
but the following indicates in a crude way the application of steam
force something after the manner in which Heron first applied it.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a name="image_3b" id="image_3b"><img src="images/jpg003b.jpg" alt="Drawing of Turbine Engine"/></a></div>

<p>"A is a retort containing water, which is heated to steam, which issues
from the tube at B and is caught in the wheel in such a manner that the
wheel revolves. The principle is simplicity itself; and the noteworthy
fact is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page79" id="Page79">Pg 79</a></span>
that&mdash;primitive as it is&mdash;it has the
characteristic principle involved in the turbine engine of to-day. After
Heron many others attempted to use controlled steam to produce force,
until, in 1764, James Watt made discoveries which paved the way for the
modern steam engine, constituting him virtually the inventor of the
type. Thereafter, the machinery became more and more complicated and
enormous in size. Double, triple and quadruple expansion types were
introduced until, at the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, in 1876,
a giant engine was exhibited by Corliss&mdash;a marvelous engine, with
many elaborate details. Then, having reached the maximum curve of
complexity, engine construction became more and more simple, and now we
have turbine engines, such as the Parsons engines, which are all far
smaller and simpler than their grandfathers of the seventies, but at the
same time vastly more powerful and efficient.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>"In the art of piano playing we have much the same line of curve. At
first there was childlike simplicity. Then, with the further development
of the art, we find the tendency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page80" id="Page80">Pg 80</a></span> toward enormous technical
accomplishment and very great complexity. Fifty years ago technic was
everything. The art of piano playing was the art of the musical
speedometer&mdash;the art of playing the greatest number of notes in the
shortest possible time. Of course, there were a few outstanding giants,
Rubinsteins, Liszts and Chopins, who made their technic subordinate to
their message; but the public was dazzled with technic&mdash;one might
better say pyrotechnics. Now we find the circle drawing toward the point
of simplicity again. Great beauty, combined with adequate technic, is
demanded rather than enormous technic divorced from beauty.</p>

<p>"Technic represents the material side of art, as money represents the
material side of life. By all means achieve a fine technic, but do not
dream that you will be artistically happy with this alone.
Thousands&mdash;millions&mdash;of people believe that money is the basis
of great happiness, only to find, when they have accumulated vast
fortunes, that money is only one of the extraneous details which
may&mdash;or may not&mdash;contribute to real content in life.</p>

<p>"Technic is a chest of tools from which the skilled artisan draws what
he needs at the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page81" id="Page81">Pg 81</a></span>
time for the right purpose. The mere
possession of the tools means nothing; it is the instinct&mdash;the
artistic intuition as to when and how to use the tools&mdash;that
counts. It is like opening the drawer and finding what one needs at the
moment.</p>

<p>"There is a technic which liberates and a technic which represses the
artistic self. All technic ought to be a means of expression. It is
perfectly possible to accumulate a technic that is next to useless. I
recall the case of a musician in Paris who studied counterpoint, harmony
and fugue for eight years, and at the end of that time he was incapable
of using any of his knowledge in practical musical composition. Why?
Because he had spent all of his time on the mere dry technic of
composition, and none in actual composition. He told me that he had been
years trying to link his technic to the artistic side of things&mdash;to
write compositions that embodied real music, and not merely the reflex
of uninspired technical exercises. I am a firm believer in having
technic go hand in hand with veritable musical development from the
start. Neither can be studied alone; one must balance the other. The
teacher who gives a pupil a long course in strict technic<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page82" id="Page82">Pg 82</a></span> unbroken by the intelligent study of
real music, is producing a musical mechanic&mdash;an artisan, not an
artist.</p>

<p>"Please do not quote me as making a diatribe against technic. I believe
in technic to the fullest extent in its proper place. Rosenthal, who was
unquestionably one of the greatest technicians, once said to me: 'I have
found that the people who claim that technic is not an important thing
in piano playing simply do not possess it.' For instance, one hears now
and then that scales are unnecessary in piano practice. A well-played
scale is a truly beautiful thing, but few people play them well because
they do not practice them enough. Scales are among the most difficult
things in piano playing; and how the student who aspires to rise above
mediocrity can hope to succeed without a thorough and far-reaching drill
in all kinds of scales, I do not know. I do know, however, that I was
drilled unrelentingly in them, and that I have been grateful for this
all my life. Do not despise scales, but rather seek to make them
beautiful.</p>

<p>"The clever teacher will always find some piece that will illustrate the
use and result of the technical means employed. There are<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page83" id="Page83">Pg 83</a></span> thousands of such pieces that
indicate the use of scales, chords, arpeggios, thirds, etc., and the
pupil is encouraged to find that what he has been working so hard to
acquire may be made the source of beautiful expression in a real piece
of music. This, to my mind, should be part of the regular program of the
student from the very start; and it is what I mean when I say that the
work of the pupil in technic and in musical appreciation should go hand
in hand from the beginning.</p>

<p>"The use of the pedal is an art in itself. Unfortunately, with many it
is an expedient to shield deficiency&mdash;a cloak to cover up
inaccuracy and poor touch. It is employed as the veils that fading
dowagers adopt to obscure wrinkles. The pedal is even more than a medium
of coloring. It provides the background so indispensable in artistic
playing. Imagine a picture painted without any background and you may
have an inkling of what the effect of the properly used pedal is in
piano playing. It has always seemed to me that it does in piano playing
what the wind instruments do in the tonal mass of the orchestra. The
wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page84" id="Page84">Pg 84</a></span>
instruments usually make a sort of background for the music
of the other instruments. One who has attended the rehearsal of a great
orchestra and has heard the violins rehearsed alone, and then together
with the wind instruments, will understand exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>"How and when to introduce the pedal to provide certain effects is
almost the study of a lifetime. From the very start, where the student
is taught the bad effect of holding down the 'loud' pedal while two
unrelated chords are played, to the time when he is taught to use the
pedal for the accomplishment of atmospheric effects that are like
painting in the most subtle and delicate shades, the study of the pedal
is continuously a source of the most interesting experiment and
revelation.</p>

<p>"There should be no hard-and-fast rules governing the use of the pedal.
It is the branch of pianoforte playing in which there must always be the
greatest latitude. For instance, in the playing of Bach's works on the
modern pianoforte there seems to have been a very great deal of
confusion as to the propriety of the use of the pedal. The Bach music,
which is played now on the keyboard of the modern piano, was, for the
most part, originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page85" id="Page85">Pg 85</a></span>
written for either the clavier or for the
organ. The clavichord had a very short sound, resembling in a way the
staccato touch on the present-day piano, whereas the organ was and is
capable of a great volume of sound of sustained quality. Due to the
contradictory nature of these two instruments and the fact that many
people do not know whether a composition at hand was written for the
clavichord or for the organ, some of them try to imitate the organ sound
by holding the pedal all the time or most of the time, while others try
to imitate the clavichord and refrain from the use of the pedal
altogether. The extreme theories, as in the case of all extreme
theories, are undoubtedly wrong.</p>

<p>"One may have the clavichord in mind in playing one piece and the organ
in mind in playing another. There can be nothing wrong about that, but
to transform the modern pianoforte, which has distinctly specific tonal
attributes, into a clavichord or into an organ must result in a tonal
abuse.</p>

<p>"The pedal is just as much a part of the pianoforte as are the stops and
the couplers a part of the organ or the brass tangents a part of the
clavichord. It is artistically impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page86" id="Page86">Pg 86</a></span>
to so camouflage the
tone of the pianoforte as to make it sound like either the organ or the
clavichord. Even were this possible, the clavichord is an instrument
which is out of date, though the music of Bach is still a part and
parcel of the musical literature of to-day. The oldest known specimen of
the clavichord (dated 1537) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New
York City. Should you happen to view this instrument you would realize
at once that its action is entirely different from that of the piano,
just as its tone was different. You cannot possibly make a piano sound
like a clavichord through any medium of touch or pedals. Therefore, why
not play the piano as a piano? Why try to do the impossible thing in
endeavoring to make the piano sound like another instrument of a
different mechanism? Why not make a piano sound like a piano? Must we
always endure listening to Wagner's music in a variety show and to
Strauss' waltzes in Carnegie Hall?</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>"If one were to ask me what is the indispensable thing in the education
of a pianist, I would say: 'First of all, a good guide.' By<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page87" id="Page87">Pg 87</a></span> this I do not mean merely a good
teacher, but rather a mentor, a pilot who can and who will oversee the
early steps of the career of a young person. In my own case, I was
fortunate in having a father, a professional musician, who realized my
musical possibilities, and from the very beginning was intensely
interested in my career, not merely as a father, but as an artist
guiding and piloting every day of my early life. Fate is such a peculiar
mystery, and the student, in his young life, can have but a slight idea
of what is before him in the future. Therefore, the need of a mentor is
essential. I am sure that my father was the author of a great deal of
the success that I have enjoyed. It was he who took me to Moszkowski and
Rubinstein. The critical advice&mdash;especially that of
Rubinstein&mdash;was invaluable to me. The student should have
unrelenting criticism from a master mind. Even when it is caustic, as
was von B&#xfc;low's, it may be very beneficial. I remember once in the home
of Moszkowski that I played for von B&#xfc;low. The taciturn, cynical
conductor-pianist simply crushed me with his criticism of my playing.
But, young though I was, I was not so conceited as to fail to realize
that he was right. I shook hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page88" id="Page88">Pg 88</a></span>
with him and thanked him for
his advice and criticism. Von B&#xfc;low laughed and said, 'Why do you thank
me? It is like the chicken thanking the one who had eaten it, for doing
so.' Von B&#xfc;low, on that same day played in such a jumbled manner with
his old, stiffened fingers, that I asked Moszkowski how in the world it
might be possible for von B&#xfc;low to keep a concert engagement which I
knew him to have a few days later in Berlin. Moszkowski replied: 'Let
von B&#xfc;low alone for that. You don't know him. If he sets out to do
something, he is going to do it.'</p>

<p>"Von B&#xfc;low's playing, however, was almost always pedantic, although
unquestionably scholarly. There was none of the leonine spontaneity of
Rubinstein. Rubinstein was a very exacting schoolmaster at the piano
when he first undertook to train me; but he often said to me, 'The main
object is to make the music sound right, even though you have to play
with your nose!' With Rubinstein there was no <i>ignus fatuus</i> of mere
method. Any method that would lead to fine artistic results&mdash;to
beautiful and effective performance&mdash;was justifiable in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Finally, to the student let me say: 'Always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page89" id="Page89">Pg 89</a></span> work hard and
strive to do your best. Secure a reliable mentor if you can possibly do
so, and depend upon his advice as to your career. Even with the best
advice there is always the element of fate&mdash;the introduction of the
unknown&mdash;the strangeness of coincidence which would almost make one
believe in astrology and its dictum that our terrestrial course may be
guided by the stars. In 1887, when I played in Washington as a child of
eleven, I was introduced to a young lady, who was the daughter of
Senator James B. Eustis. Little did I dream that this young woman, of
all the hundreds and hundreds of girls introduced to me during my tours,
would some day be my wife. Fate plays its r&#xf4;le&mdash;but do not be
tempted into the fallacious belief that success and everything else
depend upon fate, for the biggest factor is, after all, hard work and
intelligent guidance.'"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /> <h2>A FOREWORD</h2>


<p>This little book is compiled from the questions and my answers to them,
as they have appeared during the past two years in the <i>Ladies' Home
Journal</i>. Since the questions came mostly from young piano students and
cover a large number of matters important to the study of the piano, it
was thought that this republication might be of interest to piano
students in general, and that, gathered into a little volume, they might
form a new and perhaps not unwelcome sort of reference book.</p>

<p>To serve as such and to facilitate the reader's search for any
particular subject, I have grouped the questions, together with their
answers, under special headings.</p>

<p>It is only natural, however, that a book of this character cannot
contain more than mere suggestions to stimulate the reader's individual
thinking. Positive facts, which can be found in books on musical history
and in kindred works,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">Pg vi</a></span>
are, therefore, stated only where they are
needful as a basis for the replies. Any rule or advice given to some
particular person cannot fit every other person unless it is passed
through the sieve of one's own individual intelligence and is, by this
process, so modified as to fit one's own particular case.</p>

<p>There are, in addition to the questions presented and answered, one or
two points about piano-playing that would naturally not occur to the
average student. The opportunity to discuss those here is too favourable
to be allowed to pass, and as they hardly admit of precise
classification, I venture to offer them here as a brief foreword.</p>

<p>To the hundreds of students who at various times have asked me: What is
the quickest way to become a great piano-player? I will say that such a
thing as a royal road, a secret trick, or a patent method to quickly
become a great artist, does not exist. As the world consists of atoms;
as it is the infinitely small things that have forced the microscope
into the scientist's hand, so does art contain numberless small,
seemingly insignificant things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">Pg vii</a></span> which, if neglected entirely,
visit dire vengeance upon the student. Instead of prematurely concerning
himself with his inspiration, spirituality, genius, fancy, etc., and
neglecting on their account the material side of piano study, the
student should be willing to progress from atom to atom, slowly,
deliberately, but with absolute certainty that each problem has been
completely solved, each difficulty fully overcome, before he faces the
next one. Leaps, there are none!</p>

<p>Unquestionably it does sometimes happen that an artist suddenly acquires
a wide renown. In such a case his leap was not into greatness, but
merely into the public's recognition of it; the greatness must have been
in him for some time before the public became aware of it. If there was
any leaping, it was not the artist, but the public that did it.</p>

<p>Let us not close our eyes to the fact that there have been&mdash;and
probably always will be&mdash;artists that gain a wide renown <i>without</i>
being great; puffery, aided by some personal eccentricity, is quite able
to mislead the public, but these will, at best, do it only for a short
time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">Pg viii</a></span>
the collapse of such a reputation, as collapse there
must be, is always sure, and sad to behold.</p>

<p>The buoyancy of mind, its ability to soar, so necessary for both
creative and interpretative art, these are never impaired by close
attention to detail. If they should be destroyed by attention to detail,
it would not matter, for they cannot have been genuine; they can have
been but sentimental imaginings. Details are the very steps which, one
by one, lead to the summit of art; we should be careful not to lift one
foot before the other one rests quite securely upon its step. One
should&mdash;to illustrate&mdash;not be satisfied with the ability of
"getting through" some difficult passage "by the skin of the teeth" or
"without breaking down," but should strive to be able to play <i>with</i> it,
to toy with it, in order to have it at one's beck and call in any
variation of mood, so as to play it as it pleases the mind and not only
the fingers. One should acquire sovereignty over it.</p>

<p>This sovereignty is technique. But&mdash;technique is not art. It is
only a means to achieve art, a paver of the path toward<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">Pg ix</a></span> it. The danger of confounding
technique with art itself is not inconsiderable, since it takes a long
time to develop a trustworthy technique; and this prolonged association
with one subject is apt to give it supremacy over all others in one's
mind. To guard against this serious danger the student should, above
all, never lose sight of the fact that music, as does any other art,
springs from our innate craving for individual expression. As
word-thought is transmitted from man to man by verbal language so are
feelings, emotions, moods&mdash;crystallized into
tone-thought&mdash;conveyed by music. The effects of music may,
therefore, be ennobling and refining; but they can as easily be
degrading and demoralizing. For the saints and sinners among
music-makers are probably in the same proportion as among the followers
of other professions. The ethical value of music depends, therefore, not
upon the musician's technique, but solely upon his moral tendencies. The
student should never strive to dazzle his auditor's ear with mere
technical brilliancy, but should endeavour to gladden his heart, to
refine his feelings and sensibilities, by transmitting noble
musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">Pg x</a></span>
thoughts to his mind. He should scorn all unnecessary,
charlatanish externalities and strive ever for the inwardness of the
composition he interprets; for, in being honest to the composition he
will also be honest to himself and thus, consciously or not, express his
own best self. If all musicians were sincere in this endeavour there
could be neither envy nor jealousy among them; advancing hand in hand
toward their common ideal they could not help being of mutual assistance
to each other.</p>

<p>Art, not unlike religion, needs an altar around which its devotees may
congregate. Liszt, in his day, had erected such an altar in Weimar, and
as its high priest he stood, himself, before it&mdash;a luminous example
of devotion to art. Rubinstein did the same in St. Petersburg. Out of
these atmospheres, thanks to the inspiring influences of Liszt's and
Rubinstein's wonderful personalities, there have emerged a large number
of highly meritorious and some eminent artists. That many of them have
lacked the power in their later life to withstand the temptations of
quick material gain by descending to a lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">Pg xi</a></span> plane is to be
regretted, but&mdash;such is life. Many are called, but few are chosen.
Since those days several of these "many" have attempted to create
similar centres in Europe. They failed, because they were not serving
art, but rather made art serve their own worldly purposes.</p>

<p>The artists of talent no longer group themselves around the man of
genius. Perhaps he is not to be found just now. Each little celebrity
among the pianists keeps nowadays a shop of his own and all to himself.
Many of these shops are "mints," and some of them produce counterfeits.
As a matter of course, this separative system precludes all unification
of artistic principles and is, therefore, very harmful to the present
generation of students. The honest student who will discriminate between
these, sometimes cleverly masked, counterfeit mints, and a real art
altar must be of a character in which high principles are natively
ingrained. It might help him somewhat to remember that when there is no
good to choose we can always reject the bad.</p>

<p>What is true of teachers is just as true of compositions. The student
should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">Pg xii</a></span>
listen to&mdash;should not, at least, repeat the
hearing of&mdash;bad compositions, though they may be called symphonies
or operas. And he can, in a considerable measure, rely upon his own
instincts in this matter. He may not&mdash;and probably will
not&mdash;fully fathom the depths of a new symphony at its first
hearing, but he must have received general impressions of sufficient
power and clearness to make him <i>wish</i> for another hearing. When this
wish is absent he should not hear the work again from a mere sense of
duty; it were far wiser to avoid another hearing, for habit is a strong
factor, and if we accustom our ear to hear cacophonous music we are apt
to lose our aversion to it, which is tantamount to a loss of good,
natural taste. It is with much of modern music as it is with opium,
morphine, and other deadly drugs. We should shun their very touch. These
musical opiates are sometimes manufactured by persons of considerable
renown; of such quickly gained renown as may be acquired nowadays by the
employment of commercialistic methods; a possibility for which the venal
portion of the public press must bear part of the blame. The
student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">Pg xiii</a></span>
should not be deceived by names of which the general
familiarity is of too recent a date. I repeat that he should rather
consult his own feelings and by following them contribute his modest
share toward sending some of the present "moderns" back into their
deserved obscurity and insignificance.</p>

<p>I use the term "moderns" advisedly, for the true masters&mdash;some of
whom died but recently&mdash;have never stooped to those methods of
self-aggrandisement at which I hinted. Their places of honour were
accorded to them by the world because they were theirs, by right of
their artistic power, their genius and the purity of their art. My
advice to the students and to all lovers of music is: Hold on with all
your might to the school of sincerity and chastity in music! It is saner
and, morally and &#xe6;sthetically, safer than the entire pack of our present
nerve-tickling, aye, and nerve-racking "modernists." Music should always
elevate; it should always call forth what, according to the demands of
time and place, is best in us. When, instead of serving this divine
mission, it speculates upon, and arouses, our lowest instincts for no
better purpose than to fill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">Pg xiv</a></span> the pockets of its perpetrator, it
should receive neither the help nor the encouraging attention of any
noble-thinking and clean-minded man or woman. Passive resistance can do
a good deal on these premises.</p>

<p>The matter of abstention from a certain type of music recalls to my mind
another evil from which Americans should abstain; it is the curious and
out-of-date superstition that music can be studied abroad better than
here. While their number is not very large, I personally can name five
American teachers who have struggled here for many a year without
gaining that high recognition which they deserve. And now? Now they are
in the various capitals of Europe, receiving the highest fees that were
ever paid for instruction, and they receive these high fees from
American students that throng their studios. That the indifference of
their compatriots drove these men practically out of their country
proved to be of advantage to them; but how ought those to be regarded
who failed to keep them here? The wrong is irreparable in so far as
these men do not think of returning to America except as visitors. The
duty of American students and lovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">Pg xv</a></span>
of good music is to see to
it that such capable teachers as <i>are</i> still here should <i>remain</i> here.
The mass of emigration to Europe of our music students should cease! If
a student has what is understood by "finished" his studies here and his
teacher sets him free, he may make a reconnoitring tour in Europe. The
change of views and customs will, no doubt, broaden his mind in certain
directions. But musically speaking, he will be sure to find that most of
the enchantment of Europe was due to its distance. Excepting the
excellent orchestras of Europe and speaking of the general music-making
there, it is at present not quite as good as it is here: neither is the
average music teacher in Europe a whit better than the man of equal
standing here.</p>

<p>Americans should take cognizance of the fact that their country has not
stood still in music any more than in any other direction. Each year has
recorded an advancing step in its development. We must cease to compare
the Europe of to-day with the America of fifty years ago. At present
there is an astonishingly large number of clever and capable
musicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">Pg xvi</a></span>
in America, and, as with good physicians and lawyers,
their ability usually stands in inverse proportion to the amount of
their advertising. It is these worthy teachers for whose sake the
superstition of "studying abroad" should be foresworn. What Uncle Sam
has, in the field of music, not directly produced he has acquired by the
natural law of attraction; now that so many talented and learned
instructors, both native and foreign, are here they should be given a
fair opportunity to finish a pupil's development as far as a teacher can
do it, instead of seeing him, half-done, rush off "to Europe." If I were
not convinced that a change on this score is possible, I should not have
devoted so many words to it. It is merely a question of making a start.
Let me hope that each reader of this little book may start this change,
or, that, if already started, he will foster and help it. If his efforts
should be disparaged by some, he need not feel disheartened, but
remember that he belongs to the "land of limitless possibilities."</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>What Does "Technique" Mean?</i></div>

<p>What are the different techniques, and which one is most generally used?
What is the difference between them?</p>

<p>Technique is a generic term, comprising scales, arpeggios, chords,
double notes, octaves, legato, and the various staccato touches as well
as the dynamic shadings. They are all necessary to make up a complete
technique.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The More Technique the More Practice</i></div>

<p>Why do pianists who have more technique than many others practise more
than these others?</p>

<p>Why have the Rothschilds more secretaries than I have? Because the
administration of a large fortune entails more work than that of a small
one. A pianist's technique is the material portion of his artistic
possessions; it is his capital. To keep a great technique in fine
working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">Pg 4</a></span> trim is in itself a considerable and time-absorbing task.
And, besides, you know that the more we have the more we want. This
trait is not only human; it is also pianistic.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>How to Improve the Technique</i></div>

<p>Should I endeavour to improve my technique by trying difficult pieces?</p>

<p>You should not confine yourself to pieces that come easy to you, for
that would prevent all further technical progress. But beware of pieces
that are so difficult that you could not play them&mdash;in a slower
tempo&mdash;with absolute correctness. For this would lead to the ruin
of your technique and kill the joy in your studies. Play pieces that are
always a trifle harder than those you have completely mastered. Do not
emulate those who say: "I play already this or that," without asking
themselves "how" they play. Artistry depends ever upon the "how."</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Do Not Raise the Piano-Stool Too High</i></div>

<p>Are the best results at the piano attained by sitting high or low?</p>

<p>As a general rule, I do not recommend a high seat at the piano, because
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">Pg 5</a></span> induces the employment of the arm and shoulders rather than
of the fingers, and is, of course, very harmful to the technique. As to
the exact height of the seat, you will have to experiment for yourself
and find out at which height you can play longest with the least
fatigue.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Height of the Piano Seat</i></div>

<p>Is my seat at the piano to be at the same height when I practise as when
I play for people?</p>

<p>Yes! Height and distance (from the keyboard) of your chair&mdash;which
should never have arms&mdash;you should decide for yourself and once for
all time; for only then can you acquire a normal hand position, which,
in its turn, is a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for the development of your
technique. See also to it that both feet are in touch with their
respective pedals so as to be in place when their action is required. If
they stray away and you must grope for the pedals when you need them it
will lead to a break in your concentration, and this will cause you to
play less well than you really can. To let the feet stray<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_6" id="Page_6">Pg 6</a></span> from the pedals easily affects your
entire position. It is a bad habit. Alas, that bad habits are so much
easier acquired than good ones!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Tilt of The Hand in Playing Scales</i></div>

<p>Should my hand in playing scales be tilted toward the thumb or toward
the little finger? I find that in the scales with black keys it is much
easier to play the latter way.</p>

<p>I quite share your opinion, and extend it also to the scales without
black keys. I think the natural tendency of the hands is to lean toward
the little finger, and as soon as you have passed the stage of
preliminary training, as soon as you feel fairly certain that your
fingers act evenly, you may yield to their natural tendency, especially
when you strive more for speed than force; for speed does not suffer
tension, while force craves it.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Results Count, Not the Methods</i></div>

<p>Does it make any difference if my fingers are held very much curved or
only a little? I was told that Rubenstein used his fingers almost
flat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">Pg 7</a></span></p>

<p>Since you mention Rubinstein I may quote his saying: "Play with your
nose, if you will, but produce euphony (<i>Wohlklang</i>) and I will
recognize you as a master of your instrument." It is ever a question of
the result, whether you play this way or that way. If you should play
with very much curved fingers and the result should sound uneven and
pieced, change the curving little by little until you find out what
degree of curvature suits your hand best. Experiment for yourself.
Generally speaking, I recommend a free and easy position of hand and
fingers, for it is only in a position of greatest freedom that their
elasticity can be preserved, and elasticity is the chief point. By a
free and easy position I mean that natural position of hand and fingers
into which they fall when you drop your hand somewhat leisurely upon the
keyboard.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Cantabile Passages</i></div>

<p>Should a cantabile passage be played with a high finger-stroke or by
using the weight of the arm?</p>

<p>Certain characteristic moments in some pieces require the high
finger-stroke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Pg 8</a></span>
It may be used also in working up a climax, in
which case the raising of the fingers should increase proportionately to
the rise of the climax. Where, however, the strength of the fingers is
sufficient to obtain the climacteric result by pressure, instead of the
stroke, it is always preferable to use pressure. As a general principle,
I believe in the free-hanging, limp arm and recommend using its weight
in cantabile playing.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>An Incorrect Position of the Fingers</i></div>

<p>Pray how can I correct the fault of bending out the first joints of the
fingers when their cushions are pressed down upon the keys?</p>

<p>Your trouble comes under the head of faulty touch, which nothing will
correct but the constant supervision by a good teacher, assisted by a
strong exertion of your own will power and strictest attention whenever
you play. This bending out of the first joint is one of the hardest
pianistic ailments to cure, but it is curable. Do not be discouraged if
the cure is slow. The habit of years cannot be thrown off in a
day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">Pg 9</a></span></p>

<h5><a name="Action_of_the_wrist" id="Action_of_the_wrist">5. ACTION OF THE WRIST</a></h5>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Don't Stiffen the Hands in Playing Scales</i></div>

<p>Should the hands be kept perfectly still in playing scales and
arpeggios? Or, to lessen fatigue, is an occasional rise and fall of the
wrist permissible in a long passage of scale or arpeggio?</p>

<p>The hands should, indeed, be kept still, but not stiff. Protracted
passages of scales or arpeggios easily induce a stiffening of the wrist.
Hence, an occasional motion of the wrist, upward and downward, will do
much to counteract this tendency. It will, besides, be a good test of
the looseness of the wrist.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Loose Wrist</i></div>

<p>Is it not impossible to preserve a complete looseness of the wrist in
piano-playing because of the muscles that connect the forearm with the
hand?</p>

<p>By no means. You should only see to it that you do not stiffen the wrist
<i>unconsciously</i>, as most players do. The arm should be held so that the
wrist is on a line with it, not bent, and by concentrated thinking you
should endeavour to transfer the display of force to the finger-tips
instead of holding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">Pg 10</a></span> tension in your arm. For this produces
fatigue, while the way I suggest will lead you to develop considerable
force through the hand and fingers alone and leave the arm practically
limp and loose. It takes months of study under closest attention,
however, to acquire this looseness of the arm.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Position of the Wrist</i></div>

<p>Do you favour a low or high position of the wrist for average type of work?</p>

<p>For average work, I recommend an average position; neither high nor low.
Changes, upward or downward, must be made to meet the requirements of
special occasions.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Do Not Allow the Wrist to Get Stiff</i></div>

<p>If one's wrist is stiff is there any set of exercises especially adapted
to acquiring a freer movement? Or is there any special method of
exercise?</p>

<p>It depends on whether your wrist is stiff from non-use or from wrong
use. Assuming the latter, I should recommend studies in wrist octaves,
but you must watch your wrist while playing and rest at the slightest
indication of its stiffening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">Pg 11</a></span></p>

<h5><a name="Action_of_the_arm" id="Action_of_the_arm">6. ACTION OF THE ARM</a></h5>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>When Tremolo Proves Unduly Fatiguing</i></div>

<p>I cannot play tremolo in the left hand for any length of time without
great fatigue. I have tried changing the position of the hand from high
to low, the sidewise motion, and the quiet hand. What is the correct
method, and may the difficulty be overcome by slow practice?</p>

<p>The tremolo cannot be practised slowly, nor with a stiff or quiet hand.
The action must be distributed over the hand, wrist, underarm and, if
necessary, the elbow. The shoulder forms the pivot whence a vibratory
motion must proceed and engage all the points on the road to the
fingers. The division of labour cannot be done consciously, but should
better proceed from a feeling as if the whole arm was subjected to an
electric current while engaged in playing a tremolo.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Play Chords With a Loose Arm</i></div>

<p>Should octave chords be played with rigid arms, the wrists and fingers
thereby increasing the tone volume, or should the arms be loose? My
teachers differ in their methods; so I turn to you for advice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Pg 12</a></span></p>

<p>With few exceptions, dictated by certain characterizations, chords
should always be played with a loose arm. Let the arm pull the hand
above the keys and then let both fall heavily upon them, preparing the
fingers for their appropriate notes while still in the air and not, as
many do, after falling down. This mode of touch produces greater
tone-volume, is least fatiguing, and will have no bad after-effects.</p>

<h5><a name="Stretching" id="Stretching">7. STRETCHING</a></h5>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Fatiguing the Hand by Stretching</i></div>

<p>I stretch between my fingers&mdash;taking the second and third, for
instance, and trying to see how many keys I can get between them. It has
helped me, but shall I be doing wrong to continue?</p>

<p>If, as you say, you feel benefited by your stretching exercises you may
continue them. But in your place I should beware of fatigue, for while
the hand may show an improvement in its stretch while you are practising
these exercises, if it is fatigued it will afterward contract so that
its stretch is liable to become narrower than it was before.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_13" id="Page_13">Pg 13</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Do Not Injure the Hand by Stretching It</i></div>

<p>Is there any way to increase the stretch of my very small hand?</p>

<p>Any modern teacher, acquainted with stretching your hand, can devise
certain exercises that will be applicable to your particular hand. As
the lack of stretch, however, may be due to a number of different causes
I should advise you to desist from any stretch exercise that might be
recommended to you without a close examination of your hand, since the
wrong kind of exercise is not only apt, but bound, to injure it, perhaps
permanently.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Safe Way of Stretching the Small Hand</i></div>

<p>Is there any exercise, on the piano or otherwise, that would tend to
stretch my hand so as to enable me to play octaves? My fingers are short
and stubby. My teacher has not given me anything definite on this score.</p>

<p>The attempts to widen the natural stretch of the hand by artificial
means lead easily to disastrous results. It was by just such attempts
that Schumann rendered his hand useless for piano-playing. The best I
can recommend is that before playing you soak your hands in rather hot
water for several minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">Pg 14</a></span>
and then&mdash;while still in the
water&mdash;stretch the fingers of one hand with the other. By doing
this daily you will gain in stretch, provided you refrain from forcing
matters, and provided also that you are still young, and your hands are
flexible.</p>

<h5><a name="The_Thumb" id="The_Thumb">8. THE THUMB</a></h5>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">"<i>What is the Matter With My Scales?</i>"</div>

<p>What is the matter with my scales? I cannot play them without a
perceptible jerk when I use my thumb. How can I overcome the unevenness?</p>

<p>In answering this question I am in the position of a physician who is
expected to prescribe a treatment for a patient whom he has neither
examined nor even seen. I can therefore advise only in a very general
way&mdash;as I have done with many questions to avoid the eventuality of
being confronted by an exceptional case. The cause of the hand's unrest
in the passing of the thumb lies usually in transferring the thumb too
late. The thumb waits usually until the very moment when it is needed
and then quickly jumps upon the proper key, instead of moving toward it
as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">Pg 15</a></span>
as the last key it touched can be released. This
belatedness causes a jerky motion of the arm and imparts it to the hand.
Another cause lies in a fault no less grave than the first. Since the
hand has only five fingers while the scale numbers many notes (according
to its length), the player must replenish his fingers by passing the
thumb under the hand so as to form a conjunction between the notes
played and those to be played. This passing of the thumb conditions a
change or shifting of the hand toward the keys to follow, but the
shifting of the hand must not coincide with the passing of the thumb or
the result will be a jerk. The position of the hand in relation to the
keyboard must not change. It must remain the same until the thumb has
struck its new key. Not until then must the shifting of the hand take
place. In this way the jumpiness or jerkiness of the scale can be
avoided, provided one can follow this precept punctiliously&mdash;which
is not an easy matter, especially in great speed. Alas, why are those
pesky scales so difficult, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">Pg 16</a></span>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>How to Hold the Thumb</i></div>

<p>What is the correct position for the thumb? Should it be curved well

<p>In scale-playing the thumb should be slightly curved and kept near the
index finger in order to be ready when needed. In pieces this position
of the thumb cannot, of course, always be observed.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Which Fingers Demand Most Attention?</i></div>

greatest attention. Above all, you must see to it that, in touching the
keys with these fingers, you do not move the whole hand, still less the
arm.</p>

devoted to the training of those two fingers. In the Cramer Etudes
(Bulow's selection) you will find Nos. 9, 10, 11, 14, 19, 20 adapted to
your case, but do not pin your faith to the print! In all matters of art
the "how" is of far more consequence than the "what." Play what you

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Action of the Little Finger</i></div>

<p>In making wide skips in which the little finger strikes a single note,
as, for instance, in left-hand waltz accompaniments, should one strike
on the end of the little finger or on its side; and should the finger be
curved or held more or less flat?</p>

<p>The little finger should never strike with its side. It should always be
held in its normally curved condition, and straighten at the stroke only
on such occasions when its own force proves insufficient and requires
the assistance of the wrist and arm muscles.

<p>Slow trill with various touches, with highly lifted fingers producing
strength through their fall and with a lesser lift of the fingers

strikes with the tip and not with the side. Rhythmic evenness should
also be punctiliously observed.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>When the Fingers Seem Weak</i></div>

<p>If your fingers are unusually weak it may be assumed that your muscular
constitution in general is not strong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">Pg 19</a></span>
The training of the fingers alone will, in that case, lead to no decisive results. You will
have to strive for a general strengthening of your muscular fibre. At
this point, however, begins the province of your physician and mine
ends. If you consider your constitution normal, four or five hours'

<p>Is biting the finger-nails injurious to the piano touch?</p>

hand will spoil your touch. Extreme cleanliness and care in cutting the
nails the proper length are necessary to keep your hands in condition

<div class="sidenote"><i>To Prevent Sore Finger-Tips After Playing</i></div>

<p>How can I prevent my finger-tips, after prolonged playing, from feeling
sore the next day?</p>

<p>Experience teaches that in such cases, as in many others, cleanliness is
the best remedy. After playing wash your fingers at once in warm water,
with soap and brush, and then rub them well with either cold cream or
some similar fatty substance. In the development of speed on the piano,
the rigidity of the skin on the fingers is a great hindrance; it makes

<p>Unless broad-tipped fingers are of an unusual thickness I do not
consider them an obstacle in the way of good piano-playing; the less so,
as the white keys&mdash;whatever shape the fingers may have&mdash;should
never be struck between the black ones, but only in the midst of the
open space. Altogether, I hold that the shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">Pg 21</a></span>
of the hand is of
far greater importance to the pianist than the shape of his fingers; for
it furnishes the fingers with a base of operations and with a source of
strength, besides holding the entire control over them. Studying the
hands and fingers of celebrated pianists you will find a great variety
of finger shapes, while their hands are usually broad and muscular.</p>

rapid repetition touch&mdash;that is, by not allowing the fingers to
fall perpendicularly upon the keys, but rather let them make a motion as

<p>Give the preference to legato, for it produces the genuine piano tone,
and it develops the technique of the fingers; while the staccato touch
always tends to draw the arm into action. If you play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">Pg 23</a></span> from the
arm you cannot expect any benefit for the fingers. For the acquisition
of a legitimate legato Chopin's works cannot be highly enough
recommended, even in the transcriptions by Godowsky, which become
impossible when tried with any touch other than legato. He wrote them,
so to speak, out of his own hand, and his legato is so perfect that it
may well be taken as a model by anybody.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To Produce Good Legato</i></div>

<p>Should you advise me to make use of a high finger-stroke? My teacher
makes me use it exclusively, but I notice that my playing is neither
legato nor quiet. It is almost humpy.</p>

<p>Your manner of putting the question expressed your own&mdash;and
correct&mdash;judgment in the matter. This playing "in the air" is lost
energy, and will not lead to a good legato. The most beautiful tone in
legato style is ever produced by a "clinging and singing" gliding of the
fingers over the keys. Of course, you have to watch your touch in order
that your "clinging" does not deteriorate into "blurring," and that your
"gliding" may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">Pg 24</a></span> not turn into "smearing." If you apprehend any
such calamity you must for a while increase the raising of your fingers
and use more force in their falling upon the keys. Under constant
self-observation and keen listening you may, after a while, return to
the gliding manner. This much in general; of course, there are places
and passages where just the opposite of my advice could be said, but
still I think that the high finger-stroke should rather be employed for
some special characteristic effects than as a general principle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Firm and Crisp Legato Touch</i></div>

<p>I am confused by the terms "firm legato touch" and "crisp legato touch."
Wherein lies the difference?</p>

<p>Legato means "bound together," for which we substitute the word
"connected." Two tones are either connected or they are not connected.
The idea of various kinds of legato is purely a sophism, a product of
non-musical hyper-analysis. By "legato" I understand the connecting of
tones with each other through the agency of the fingers (on the piano).
The finger that evoked a tone should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">Pg 25</a></span> leave its key until the
tone generated by the next finger has been perceived by the ear. This
rule governs the playing of melodies and slow passages. In rapid
passages, where the control through the ear is lessened, the legato is
produced by more strictly mechanical means, but there should,
nevertheless, always be two fingers simultaneously occupied. Do not take
the over-smart differentiations of legato seriously. There is no plural
to the word "legato."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the force of touch and its various gradations are entirely

America; but it was soon abandoned. If you have a piece of sheet music

advantage of the universal fingering lies in its greater simplicity, and
in the circumstance that it is universally adopted.

<p>When should I use the arm to play octaves as I have seen some concert

slightest motion from the wrist.</p>

<p>Most concert players play their octaves more from the arm than from the
wrist, but their wrist is nevertheless not so inactive as it seems to
have appeared to you. They have probably distributed the work over the
wrist, the elbow, and the shoulder in such a way that each had to do
only a part of it. Light octaves can come only from the wrist, while
heavier ones put the elbow and shoulder into action. To make this
distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">Pg 32</a></span>
consciously is hardly possible. A striving for
economy of force and the least possible fatigue will produce this

the height of the wrist?</p>

<p>In extended octave playing it is well to vary the position of the wrist,
now high and then low. The low position brings the forearm into action,
while the whole arm co&#xf6;perates when the wrist is held high. From the
wrist alone such pieces as "The Erlking" cannot be played, because the
wrist alone gives us neither the power nor the speed that such pieces
require. Besides, the octaves, when all played from the wrist, would
sound "cottony." The wrist alone is to be used only in light, graceful
places.

practising octaves or double notes think always of holding the arm and

<p>Premature fatigue is usually caused by undue muscular contraction. Keep
your arms and wrists loose and you will find that the fatigue
disappears. For your sensation of fatigue may be due, not to exhaustion
of muscular power, but to a stoppage of circulation caused by an

this you need, first of all, a loose wrist.
Furthermore, you should not, in repetition technique, let the fingers

Far, rather, may the piano be bad when you play for
people. This will not hurt you nearly so much as will the constant and
habitual use of a piano with a mechanism in which every key demands a
different kind of touch, and which is possibly out of tune. Such
conditions impair the development of your musical ear as well as of your
fingers. It cannot be otherwise. As I said once before, learning means
the acquiring of habits: habits of thinking and of doing. With a bad
instrument you cannot develop any good qualities, even if you should
possess them by nature; much less can you acquire them. Hence, I
recommend a good piano, clean keyboard&mdash;for your &#xe6;sthetic

<p>All extremes are harmful in their effects upon study and practice. A too

colours upon the palette of a painter who strives for some particular
shade or tint. He knows that blue and yellow make green, that red and
blue make purple; but those are ground colours which he can rarely use.
For the finer shades he has to experiment, to consult his eye and his
judgment. The relation between the pedal and the player's ear is exactly"ALPHABETICAL_INDEX_OF"
similar to that of the palette and the painter's eye. Generally speaking
(from sad experience) it is far more important to know when <i>not</i> to use
the pedal than when to use it. We must refrain from its use whenever
there is the slightest danger of unintentional mingling of tones. This
is best avoided by taking the pedal <i>after</i> striking the tone upon which
it is to act, and to release it promptly and simultaneously with the
striking of the next tone. It may be at once taken again, and this
alternation must be kept up where there is either a change of harmony or
a succession of "passing notes." This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">Pg 41</a></span>

I can give, but even this is often violated. Let your ear be the

tone and thus produces effects not dissimilar to the organ.

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Morning Practice On the Piano</i></div>

<p>In resuming my studies in the morning what should I play first?</p>

<p>Begin with your technical work. Scales in all tonalities, each at least
twice well rendered. First slowly, one after another, then somewhat
quicker, but never very quickly as long as you are not absolutely sure
that both hands are perfectly even, and that neither false notes nor
wrong fingerings occur. To play the scales wrong is just as much a
matter of habit as to play them right&mdash;only easier. You can get
very firmly settled in the habit of striking a certain note wrong every
time it occurs unless you take the trouble of counteracting the
formation of such a habit. After these scales play them in octaves from
the wrist, slowly and without tiring it by lifting the hand to a
needless height. After this play either Czerny or Cramer,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_46" id="Page_46">Pg 46</a></span> then Bach, and finally Mozart,
Beethoven, Chopin, and so on. If you have the time to do it, play one
hour in the morning on technical studies and use one hour for the
difficult places in the works you are studying. In the afternoon play
another hour, and this hour you devote to interpretation. I mean by this
that you should now apply &#xe6;sthetically what you have technically gained
in the morning by uniting your mechanical advantages with the ideal
conception which you have formed in your mind of the work you are
studying.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Morning Is the Best Time to Practise</i></div>

<p>How much time should I spend on clearly technical study? I am practising
three hours a day; how long should I practise at a time?</p>

<p>Purely technical work&mdash;that is, work of the fingers without the
participation of mind and heart&mdash;you should do little or none, for
it kills your musical spirit. If, as you say, you practise three hours a
day I should recommend two hours in succession in the morning and one
hour in the afternoon. The morning is always the best time for work.
Make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">Pg 47</a></span>
no long pauses in your work, for they would break your
contact with the piano and it would take considerable time to
re&#xeb;stablish it. In the afternoon, after the major portion of your daily
task is done, you may move with greater freedom, though even this
freedom should be kept within proper bounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Time to Devote to Technical Exercises</i></div>

<p>Should I practise studies in general for my progress or should I confine
myself strictly to my technical exercises?</p>

<p>Your strictly technical exercises should occupy one-quarter of the
entire time you can give to your work. Two quarters you should use for
the technical preparation of the difficult passages you encounter in the
pieces you are studying, and during the last quarter these passages
which have been thus prepared should be ranged into their proper places
in the pieces, in order that you may not lose your view of the totality
of the pieces while studying or practising details.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Only Kind of Practice Worth While</i></div>

<p>In purely technical, <i>i. e.</i>, mechanical, practice may I have a book or

<p>This question will appear grotesque to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">Pg 48</a></span>any one who has not
thought of it, yet it is legitimate; for I know positively that this
crime upon themselves has been committed by many. I cannot warn students
too strongly against this pernicious habit. It is far better to practise
only half as long, but with concentrated attention. Even purely
mechanical matter must be transmitted to the motor-centres of the brain
through the agencies of the ear and eye in order to bring beneficial
technical results. If the brain is otherwise occupied it becomes
insensible to the impression of the work in hand, and practise thus done
is a complete waste of time. Not only should we not read, but also not
think of anything else but the work before us, if we expect results.
Concentration is the first letter in the alphabet of success.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Practising Eight Hours Instead of Four</i></div>

<p>Will I advance quicker by practising eight hours instead of four, as I

<p>Playing too much in one day has often a deteriorating effect upon one's
studies, because work is profitable, after all, only if done with full
mental concentration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">Pg 49</a></span>
which can be sustained only for a certain
length of time. Some exhaust their power of concentration quicker than
others; but, however long it may have lasted, once it is exhausted all
further work is like unrolling a scroll which we have laboriously rolled
up. Practise self-examination, and if you notice that your interest is
waning&mdash;stop. Remember that in studying the matter of quantity is
of moment only when coupled with quality. Attention, concentration,
devotion, will make unnecessary any inquiries as to how much you ought
to practise.</p>

<p>Shall I, when my hands are cold and stiff, play at once difficult and

<p>In forcing things with cold hands you always run the danger of
overstraining, while with a gradual limbering you may safely try the
same tasks with impunity. Handle the piano lightly while the hands are
cold, and increase both force and speed only when the hands have gained
their normal temperature and elasticity. This may take half or even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">Pg 50</a></span>
three-quarters of an hour. It may be accelerated by putting the
hands in hot water before playing, but this should not be done too
often, because it is apt to weaken the nerves of the hands.</p>

<p>Loud counting can hardly ever be injurious&mdash;especially not while
the pupil is dealing with time and rhythm. This part mastered or fully
understood, the audible counting may be lessened and finally abandoned.
During practice loud counting is of inestimable value, for it develops
and strengthens rhythmic feeling better than anything else will, and,
besides, it is an infallible guide to find the points of stress in a
phrase.</p>

prepared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">Pg 51</a></span>
After that, however, I consider the practising of

mental picture of it. If the player's technique is too insufficient for
this the deciphering

<p>Provided you have formed a general idea of the piece, it is well to
practise the hands separately, because you can, in this way, concentrate
your attention upon the work of each hand. As soon, however, as each

pursue the musical purpose for which the separate practice was only a

<p>Even if I did believe in metronomes, as I do not, I could not indicate
speed for you or for anybody, because it will always depend upon the
state of your technique and the quality of your tone. For modern parlour
pieces I suggest the two volumes of Russian piano music published by G.
Schirmer, New York. You will find pieces of various degrees of
difficulty there from which you may select what suits you best.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>To Work Up a Fast Tempo</i></div>

<p>Which is the best way to work up a fast tempo?</p>

<p>The best help is to hear the piece or part which you have in mind played
quickly by another person, for this aids you in forming the mental
concept of it, which is the principal condition to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">Pg 54</a></span> which all
ability is subject. There are, however, other ways which each one of us
must find for himself: either by a gradual increase of speed until you
reach your individual maximum or by starting at once at full tilt, even
though some notes should drop under the piano and then be picked up in
subsequent repetitions. Which of these two or any other ways is best for
you no one can tell; your musical instinct will guide you if you follow
it cautiously.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Best Way to Work Up a Quick Tempo</i></div>

<p>Is it ever a waste of time to practise a piece over and over again for
months as slowly as a beginner and with utmost concentration? After
having done so and gradually working up a tempo, I then find I cannot
play so fast as I want to. Is it not wise to begin all over again as
slowly as possible? I prefer to work this way, but have been told that
one gets "stale," studying the same music for a long time.</p>

<p>Do you advise practising with or without the pedal?</p>

<p>Slow practice is undoubtedly the basis for quick playing; but quick
playing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">Pg 55</a></span>
not an immediate result of slow practice. Quick
playing must be tried from time to time, with increasing frequency and
heightened speed, even at a temporary loss of clearness. This loss is
easily regained by subsequent returns to slow practice. After all, we
must first learn to think quickly through the course of a piece before
we can play it quickly, and this mental endeavour, too, will be greatly
aided by occasional trials in a quicker tempo. As for getting "stale," a
variety of pieces is necessary to preserve the freshness of each one.</p>

<p>Regarding the pedal, I suggest that you use it judiciously from the very
beginning of the study of a new piece; though never in finger exercises.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Watch Your Breathing</i></div>

<p>What is the purpose of associating breathing with piano playing, and to
what extent should it be practised?</p>

<p>Breathing is as important in piano playing as in all physical exertion,
and more so when we speak of pieces that entail the use of great
muscular force; for this causes a quickening in the action of the heart;
respiration naturally keeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">Pg 56</a></span>
step with it, and the result is
often a forcible breathing through the mouth. Players resort to
open-mouth breathing in such cases because they cannot help themselves.
If, at the last spurt of a bicycle race, we should call to the wheelmen,
"Breathe through the nose!" we could not wonder if our advice remains
unheeded. This open-mouth breathing, however, need not be learned; it is
the self-help of nature. I recommend breathing through the nose as long
as possible. It is more wholesome than mouth-breathing, and it refreshes
the head more. When physical exertion becomes too great then you will
neither need nor heed my advice or anybody's; your nature will find its
own line of least resistance.</p>

for a month. Such a pause renews your forces as well as the love for
your work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">Pg 57</a></span>
you will, upon resuming it, not only catch up
quickly with what you may think to have missed, but you will also make a
quick leap forward because the quality of your work will be better than
it could be if you had persisted in it with a fatigued mind. In a tired
condition of mind and body we are very apt not to notice the formation
of bad habits, and since "to learn means to form correct habits of
thinking and doing" we must beware of anything that might impair our
watchfulness as to bad habits. The greatest persistence cannot turn a
bad habit into a virtue.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of M. M. = 72 printed over a piece of music?</p>

<p>The M stands for "metronome," the other for the name of its inventor,
Maelzl. The figures indicate the number of beats a minute and the note
shows what each beat represents&mdash;in this case a quarter note. The
whole annotation says that the average speed of the piece should admit
of seventy-two quarter notes being played in a minute. I advise you,
however, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">Pg 58</a></span>
rather to consult the state of your technique and your
own feeling for what is musically right in deciding upon the speed of
the piece.</p>

the 6-8 and 9-8 movements of Liszt's Dance of the Gnomes be
metronomized?</p>

<p>The C-sharp minor movement should not increase in speed, or only very
little, because it rises to a considerable height dynamically, and this
seems to counteract an increase of speed. As to the metronoming, I would
not bother about it. The possibilities of your technique must ever
regulate the speed question in a large degree. Tempo is so intimately
related with touch and dynamics that it is in a large measure an
individual matter. This does not mean that one may play andante where an
allegro is prescribed, but that one person's allegro differs slightly
from that of another person. Touch, tone, and conception influence the
tempo. The metronome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">Pg 59</a></span>

<p>Your teacher is eminently right. You should not play with the metronome
for any length of time, for it lames the musical pulse and kills the
vital expression in your playing. The metronome may well be used as a
controlling device first, to find the approximate average speed of a
piece, and, second, to convince yourself that, after playing for a<span class="pagenum"><a

<p>They serve as such; though our musical ancestors probably selected these
terms because of their indefiniteness, which leaves a certain margin to
our individuality. Literally, Adagio (<i>ad agio</i>) means "at leisure."
Andante means "going" in contradistinction to "running," going apace,
also walking. Allegro (a contraction of <i>al leg-gie-ro</i>) means with
"lightness, cheerful." Primarily these terms are, as you see,
indications of mood; but they have come to be regarded as speed annotations.</p>

<p>If the metronome is not indicated you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">Pg 61</a></span> have to consult your own

<p>Grace notes and their chiefs&mdash;that is, those notes to which the

minimal that it should not be discernible whether they appear

<p>Slurs and accents have nothing to do with each other, because accents

note struck at its beginning as long as the note-value at its end

<p>Slurs and accents have nothing to do with each other. Slurs indicate
either a legato touch or the grouping of the notes. Which one of the
notes thus grouped is to be accented depends upon its rhythmical
position in the measure. The strong and weak beat (or positive and
negative beat) govern the accent always, unless there is an annotation
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">Pg 64</a></span>

<p>You are quite right, theoretically. Nevertheless, the proper tonality

upon the key called C, but its musical bearing is very remote from the
note C. The same applies to double-flats (and double-sharps), for D with
a double-flat is played upon the key called C, but it has no relation to

<p>Does an accidental in the right hand influence the left?</p>

<p>Inasmuch as piano music is written in score form, the two staffs are as
independent of each other as are the staffs in an orchestral score. We
may, in cases of suspected misprints, draw certain inferences from one
staff to the other, provided that they are justified by the prevailing
harmony. As a rule, the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">Pg 67</a></span>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why Two Names for the "Same" Key?</i></div>

<p>I am often asked why there must be fifteen keys in music instead of
twelve&mdash;that is, why not always write in B instead of C-flat, in
F-sharp instead of G-flat, in D-flat instead of C-sharp, or <i>vice
versa</i>? I can only say that the circle of fifths would not be complete
without the seven scales in sharps and the seven in flats: but Bach does
not use all the fifteen keys in his Forty-eight Preludes and Fugues,
omitting entirely, in the major keys, G-flat, D-flat, and C-flat, and,
in the minor keys, A-sharp and A-flat. Are compositions in sharps
considered more brilliant than those in flats? Do composers consider
modulation in selecting their key?</p>

<p>The answer to your question hinges upon whether you recognize in music
mere tone-play or whether you concede a mental and psychic side to it.
In the former case the mode of spelling a tone C-sharp or D-flat would
be, indeed, irrelevant. But in the latter case you must admit the
necessity of a musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">Pg 68</a></span>
orthography qualified to convey distinct
tonal meanings and musical thoughts to the reader and to the player.
Though there is in the tempered scale no difference between C-sharp and
D-flat, the musical reader will conceive them as different from one
another, partly because of their connection with other related
harmonies. These determine usually the composer's selection in cases of
enharmonic identities. In the script of human language you will find an
analogy than which none could be more perfect. In English there are, for
instance, "to," "too," and "two"; words in which the spelling alone, and
not the sound of pronunciation, conveys the different meanings of the
words.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of a "motif"? What does a dash mean over a note?
What is the best book of instruction for a beginner, a child of ten?</p>

<p>A motif is the germ of a theme. A theme may be composed of reiterations
of a motif, or by grouping several motifs together; it may also combine
both modes of procedure. The most glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">Pg 69</a></span>exemplification of
construction by reiteration of a motif you will find in the opening
theme of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. A dash over a note enjoins the
player to hold that note with the finger until it has received its full
value. The best "instruction book" for a child is a good teacher who
uses no instruction book, but imparts his knowledge to the child from
out of his own inner consciousness.</p>

<p>Notes marked as above are to be played in such a manner that each note

<p>The dash under or above a note is a substitute for the word "tenuto"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">Pg 71</a></span></p>

<p>The accent ought to lie upon the first note of the mordent, but you
should not make a triplet of it by occupying the whole quarter with its
execution. The mordent must be played fast enough to preserve the
rhythmic integrity of the melody-note.</p>

alternation of the thumb and the second finger desirable in the playing
of a trill?</p>

<p>Where not expressly otherwise stated (by appoggiatura) trills usually
begin upon the melodic tone (the note which is written). Change fingers
when those employed get tired. For extended trills the use of three
fingers is advantageous, while in shorter trills two fingers will

<p>The episode you quote moves evidently in the tonality of G minor. The
trill stands on B-flat. As the auxiliary note of a trill is ever the
diatonic sequel of a stated note it must, in this case, be a whole tone

<p>While there are no "methods" for trilling there are certain means by
which sluggish muscles may be assisted. Yet, even these means cannot be
suggested without knowing the seat and cause of your trouble. The causes
differ with the individual, but they are, in the majority of cases,
purely mental, not manual. To trill quickly we must think quickly; for
if we trill only with the fingers they will soon stick, lose their
rhythmic succession, and finish in a cramped condition. Hence, there is
no direct way to learn trilling; it will develop with your general
mental-musical advancement. The main thing is, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_74" id="Page_74">Pg 74</a></span> always to listen to your own
playing, actually and physically, to perceive every tone you play; for
only then can you form an estimate as to how quickly you can "hear."

your own ear can follow.</p>

<p>The significance of the trill in measure 25 is melodic, while that of

give me your opinion?</p>

<p>In a sonata it is of serious importance to repeat the first part
(exposition) of the first movement in order that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">Pg 76</a></span> two
principal themes, as well as their tributaries, may well impress
themselves upon the mind and memory of your auditor. For, unless this is
accomplished, he cannot possibly understand and follow their development
in the next part. That the exposition part is not the only one to be
repeated you will find frequently indicated; for instance, in the last
movement of the "Appassionata," where the repetition is needful, not for
the reason stated before, but for the sake of formal balance or
proportion. Generally speaking, I am in favour of following the
composer's indications punctiliously, hence, also, his repeat marks,
which serve &#xe6;sthetic purposes that you will perhaps not understand until

<p>The truth lies midway between two extremes. While the accompaniment
should be sufficiently subdued to form, as you say, a harmonic
background, it ought, nevertheless, not to be blended to such a degree

one part of the left, add a third part, and so on until you have all the

<p>Bach's music is not the only music that develops the technique. There

<p>The explanation of the plan of a Fugue would exceed by far the limits of
the space at my disposal. It would require a text-book, of which there
are many to be found in every good music store. The Fugue is the most
legitimate representation of true polyphony. Its difference from an
Invention is expressed in the two names. A Fugue (<i>fuga</i>, flight) is the
flight of one musical thought through many voices or parts, subject to
strict rules, while an Invention is an accumulation of thoughts moving
with absolute freedom. The definition of Prelude, as something which
intentionally precedes and fittingly introduces a main action, fits the
musical Prelude perfectly; especially in the case of Bach. The purpose
of all these forms is that of all good music-making, namely, the<span class="pagenum"><a

<p>The name "Pastoral Sonata" could, no doubt, be traced to an arbitrary

because, really, its main characteristic is a rural sort of peaceful

surely, does not suggest the life of a metropolis. But in the other

<p>Since the playing of all the Sonatas does not necessarily prove that
they were all well played, I think it is better to play one Sonata well
than to play many of them badly. Nor should Beethoven's Sonatas be
regarded as a musical drilling-ground, but rather as musical
revelations. As they are not all on precisely the same high plane of
thought, it is not necessary to play them all. To familiarize yourself

To the second question my reply is that Chopin has composed "music"
which&mdash;as you know&mdash;represents thoughts only in a musical
sense, otherwise it deals with purely psychic processes, moods, etc. The
humour of this Impromptu is mainly an amiable, ingratiating one, here
and there slightly tinged with a sweet melancholy. It should not be
played too fast, for it easily loses this latter attribute<span class="pagenum"><a

<p>In Chopin's Barcarolle there is a number of trills preceded by grace
notes. Are they to be executed according to Philipp Emmanuel Bach's
rule, so that the grace notes take their time from the note that follows
them?</p>

<p>Philipp Emmanuel Bach's rule is a safe one to follow, but do not
confound a rule with a law. If you have reached that plane on which an

prompt you occasionally to depart from the rule.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly. But the extent of such liberties depends upon your &#xe6;sthetic

a specific answer is impossible without an acquaintance with your

<p>To classify composers, without specifying their works, is never
advisable. Beethoven's first and last sonatas differ so fundamentally
from each other in every particular that one may play the first one very
well and yet be for many years (perhaps forever) unable to play the last
one. And still, it is the same Beethoven that wrote both works. We can,
therefore, hardly speak of an "order of composers." So long as we are
dealing with masters the question should not be: Which
master?&mdash;but, Which composition does your stage of mental and
technical development call for? If you will defer the study of any other

Berlioz; there were, no doubt, others, but none who belongs to the truly
great ones. The reason for this is, perhaps, the circumstance that the
pianist throughout his education is brought into touch with greater
polyphony than the players of other instruments, and that polyphony is a

<p>How must I execute triplets played against two-eighths? In Clementi's
Sonatina, Opus 37, No. 3, first page, you will find such bars.</p>

<p>In a slow tempo it may serve you to think of the second eighth-note of
the triplet as being subdivided into two sixteenths. After both hands
have played the first note of their respective groups simultaneously,
the place of the aforesaid second sixteenth is to be filled by the
second note of the couplet. In faster motion it is far better to
practise at first each hand alone and with somewhat exaggerated accents
of each group until the two relative speeds are well established in the
mind. Then try to play the two hands together in a sort of
semi-automatic way. Frequent correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">Pg 97</a></span>

<p>How should, in Chopin's Fantasy Impromptu, the four notes of the right

<p>An exact division would lead to such fractions as the musician has no
means of measuring and no terms for expressing. There is but one way to
play unequal rhythms simultaneously in both hands; study each hand
separately until you can depend upon it, and put them together without
thinking of either rhythm. Think of the points where the two hands have
to meet, the "dead points" of the two motions, and rely on your
automatism until, by frequent hearing, you have learned to listen to two
rhythms at once.</p>

separately with an exaggerated accent on each beat until the points
where the hands meet are well conceived and the relative speed ratios
are well understood. Then try to play the hands together, and do not be
discouraged if the first attempts fail. Repeat the trial often and you
will finally succeed if the separate practice has been sufficient to
produce a semi-automatic action of the hands.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Value and Correct Practice of Phrasing</i></div>

<p>Can you give an amateur a concise definition of phrasing and a few
helpful suggestions as to clear phrasing?</p>

<p>Phrasing is a rational division and subdivision of musical sentences,
and serves to make them intelligible. It corresponds closely with
punctuation in literature and its recitation. Find out the start, the
end, and the culminating point of your phrase. The last-named<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_99" id="Page_99">Pg 99</a></span> is usually to be found upon the
highest note of the phrase, while the former are usually indicated by
phrasing slurs. Generally speaking, the rising of the melody is combined
with an increase of strength up to the point of culmination, where, in
keeping with the note design, the decrease of strength sets in. For
artistic phrasing it is of the utmost importance properly to recognize
the principal mood of the piece, for this must, naturally, influence the
rendition of every detail in it. A phrase occurring in an agitated
movement, for instance, will have to be rendered very differently from a
similar-looking phrase in a slow, dreamy movement.</p>

keyboard and keep the wrist perfectly limp, so that the arm carries the

<p>Will you please tell me what is the best method of playing rubato?</p>

<p>The artistic principles ruling rubato playing are good taste and keeping
within artistic bounds. The physical principle is balance. What you
shorten of the time in one phrase or part of a phrase you must add at
the first opportunity to another in order that the time "stolen"
(rubato) in one place may be restituted in another. The &#xe6;sthetic law
demands that the total time-value of a music piece shall not be affected
by any rubato, hence, the rubato can only have sway within the limits of
such time as would be consumed if the piece were played in the strictest
time.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>How to Play Passages Marked "Rubato"</i></div>

<p>I find an explanation of <i>tempo rubato</i> which says that the hand which
plays the melody may move with all possible freedom, while the
accompanying hand must keep strict time. How can this be done?</p>

<p>The explanation you found, while not absolutely wrong, is very
misleading, for it can find application only in a very few isolated
cases; only inside of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">Pg 101</a></span>
short phrase and then hardly satisfactorily. Besides, the words you quote are not an explanation, but
a mere assertion or, rather, allegation. <i>Tempo rubato</i> means a
wavering, a vacillating of time values, and the question whether this is
to extend over both hands or over only one must be decided by the
player's good taste; it also depends upon whether the occupation of the
two hands can be thought of as separate and musically independent. I
assume that you are able to play each hand alone with perfect freedom,
and I doubt not that you can, with some practice, retain this freedom of
each hand when you unite them, but I can see only very few cases to
which you could apply such skill, and still less do I see the advantage
thereof.</p>

<p>Perfect expression is possible only under perfect freedom. Hence, the
perfect <i>rubato</i> must be the result of momentary impulse. It is,
however, only a few very eminent players that have such command<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_102" id="Page_102">Pg 102</a></span> over this means of expression as
to feel safe in trusting their momentary impulses altogether. The
average player will do well carefully to consider the shifting of time
values and to prepare their execution to a certain degree. This should
not, however, be carried too far, as it would impair the naturalness of
expression and lead to a stereotyped mannerism.</p>

a consistent manner. Whether a certain conception of a phrase is or is

always safer first to make sure that the notes as such, and their
respective times value have been read correctly, and that the technical
difficulties have, to a fair degree, been overcome. This done, the
question must be settled as to whether the general character<span class="pagenum"><a

<p>There is but one minor scale; it is the one upon which the chords of its
tonality are built; it is the one upon which your teacher wisely
insists, because the so-called melodic minor scale offers no new
intervals to your fingers, and because the term melodic minor scale is
applied to that form of deviation from the real scale which is most
frequently used, but which is by no means the only deviation that is
possible; nor is it the only one in use.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the major and minor scales?</p>

<p>The major scale has a major third and sixth, while the minor scale has a
minor third and sixth and raises its seventh to a major seventh by an
accidental elevating sign, raising a natural note by a sharp, and a flat
note by a natural. If you begin your major scale upon its sixth degree
and, counting it as the first of the minor, raise the seventh, you
obtain the minor scale, in which, however, many modifications are
admissible for melodic (though not for harmonic) purposes.

<p>Waltz, menuet, mazurka, and polonaise are all in three-fourth time and
are not confined to a definite tempo. The difference between them lies
in the structure. A waltz period&mdash;that is, the full expression of a
theme&mdash;needs sixteen measures; a menuet needs only eight, a mazurka
only four measures. In a mazurka a motive occupies only one measure, in
the menuet two, and in the waltz four. The polonaise subdivides its
quarters into eighths, and the second eighth usually into two
sixteenths; it differs, therefore, from the other three dances by its
rhythm.</p>

Toccata by Chaminade.</p>

<p>To make the matter quite plain let me say, first, that "Cantata"
(from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">Pg 112</a></span>
<i>cantare</i>&mdash;to sing) meant in olden times a music
piece to be sung; while "Sonata" (from <i>suonare</i>&mdash;to play)
designated a piece to be played on an instrument; and "Toccato" meant a
piece for keyboard instruments like the organ or piano and its
precursors, written with the intention of providing special
opportunities for the display of the skill of touch (from
<i>toccare</i>&mdash;to touch) or, as we would now say, finger technique. The
original meanings have changed so that these terms now imply definite
forms, like the modern Cantata and Sonata. The Toccata is, at present,
understood to be a piece in constant and regular motion, very much like
those that are called "<i>moto perpetuo</i>" or "perpetual motion," of which
Weber's "Perpetuum mobile" is a good example. I have no doubt that the
Toccata by Chaminade, which I do not know, is written on similar lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Playing from Memory Is Indispensable</i></div>

<p>Is memorization absolutely essential to a good player?</p>

<p>Playing from memory is indispensable to the freedom of rendition. You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">Pg 113</a></span>
to bear in your mind and memory the whole piece in order
to attend properly to its details. Some renowned players who take the
printed sheets before them on the stage play, nevertheless, from memory.
They take the music with them only to heighten their feeling of security
and to counteract a lack of confidence in their memory&mdash;a species
of nervousness.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Easiest Way to Memorize</i></div>

<p>Will you please tell me which is the easiest way to memorize a piano
piece?</p>

<p>Begin by playing it a few times very carefully and slowly until you can
play it with a fair degree of exactitude (you need not mind an
occasional stopping). Then go over such places as appeared to you
especially complex until you understand their construction. Now let the
piece rest for a whole day and try to trace in your mind the train of
thoughts in the piece. Should you come to a dead stop be satisfied with
what you have achieved. Your mind will keep on working, subconsciously,
as over a puzzle, always trying to find the continuation. If you find
that the memory is a blank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">Pg 114</a></span>
take the music in hand, look at the
particular place&mdash;but only at this&mdash;and, since you have now
found the connection, continue the work of mental tracing. At the next
stop repeat this procedure until you have reached the end, not in every
detail, but in large outlines. Of course, this does not mean that you
can now <i>play</i> it from memory. You have only arrived at the point of
transition from the imagined to the real, and now begins a new kind of
study: to transfer to the instrument what you have mentally absorbed.
Try to do this piece by piece, and look into the printed sheets (which
should not be on the music-rack but away from it) only when your memory
absolutely refuses to go on. The real work with the printed music should
be reserved to the last, and you should regard it in the light of a
proof-reading of your mental impressions. The whole process of absorbing
a piece of music mentally resembles that of photographing. The
development of the acoustic picture (the tone-picture) is like the bath.
The tentative playing is like the process of "fixing" against<span class="pagenum"><a

final work with the printed music is the retouching.</p>

<p>I find it very hard to memorize my music. Can you suggest any method

<p>To retain in one's memory what does not interest one is difficult to
everybody, while that which does interest us comes easy. In your case
the first requirement seems to be that your interest in the pieces you
are to play be awakened. This interest usually comes with a deeper
understanding of music; hence, it may be said that nothing will assist a
naturally reluctant memory so much as a general musical education.
Special studies for the memory have not come to my knowledge because I
never had any need of them. After all, the best way to memorize
is&mdash;to memorize. One phrase today, another to-morrow, and so on,
until the memory grows by its own force through being exercised.</p>

But I forget them just as quickly, so that in a
few weeks I cannot remember enough of them to play them clear through.
What would you advise, to make my memory more retentive?</p>

<p>There are two fundamental types of memory: One is very mobile&mdash;it
acquires quickly and loses just as quickly; the other is more cumbrous
in its action&mdash;it acquires slowly, but retains forever. A
combination of the two is very rare, indeed; I never heard of such a
case. A remedy against forgetting you will find in refreshing your
memory in regular periods, playing your memorized pieces over
(carefully) every four or five days. Other remedies I know not and I see

The rapidity of your progress depends upon the state of your general

accompanying. To be, in this sense, a good accompanist, one must have
what is called in musical slang a good "nose"&mdash;that is, one must
musically "scent" whither the soloist is going. But, then, the nose is
one of the things we are born with. We may develop it, as to its

<p>What, please, is the quickest and safest way of transposing from one key
to another? I have trouble, for instance, in playing for singing if the
piece is in A major and the singer wants it in F major.</p>

<p>The question of transposing hinges on the process of hearing through the
eye. I mean by this that you must study the piece until you learn to
conceive the printed music as sounds and sound groups, not as key
pictures. Then transfer the sound picture to another tonality in your
mind, very much as if when moving from one floor to another with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">Pg 120</a></span>
all your household goods you were
to place them on the new floor as they were placed on the old. Practice
will, of course, facilitate this process very much. Transposition at
sight is based on somewhat different principles. Here you have to get
mentally settled in the new tonality, and then follow the course of
intervals. If you find transposition difficult you may derive
consolation from the thought that it is difficult for everybody, and
that transposing at sight is, of course, still more difficult than to
transpose after studying the piece beforehand.</p>

<p>From time to time you may play for people the pieces you have mastered,

slowly&mdash;in order to eliminate any slight errors or unevenness that
may have crept in. To play for people is not only a good incentive for
further aspirations; it also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">Pg 121</a></span>
furnishes you with a fairly exact
estimate of your abilities and shortcomings, and indicates thereby the
road to improvement. To retire from the outside world during the period
of study is an outlived, obsolete idea which probably originated in the
endeavour to curb the vanity of such students as would neglect their
studies in hunting, prematurely, for applause. I recommend playing for
people moderately and on the condition that for every such "performance"
of a piece you play it afterward twice, slowly and carefully, at home.
This will keep the piece intact and bring you many other unexpected
advantages.</p>

the score of technical security? In the latter case you ought to perfect
your technique, while in the former you must learn to discard all

you, and concentrate your thinking upon the work you are to do. This you
can well achieve by will-power and persistent self-training.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Effect of Playing the Same Piece Often</i></div>

<p>I have heard artists play the same piece year after year, and each time
as expressively as before. After a piece has been played several hundred
times it can hardly produce on the player the same emotional effect that
it originally did. Is it possible for a player by his art and technical
resources so to colour his tones that he can stimulate and produce in
his audience an emotional condition which he himself does not at the
time feel?</p>

<p>In music emotion can be conveyed only through the means and modes of
expression that are peculiar to music, such as dynamic changes,
vacillations of tempo, differences of touch and kindred devices. When a
piece is played in public very often on consecutive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">Pg 123</a></span>
occasions&mdash;which artists avoid as
much as they can&mdash;these expressions gradually assume a distinct
form which is quite capable of preservation. Though it will in time lose
its life-breath, it can still produce a deception just as (to draw a
drastic parallel) a dead person may look as if he were only asleep. In
this parallel the artist has, however, one great advantage. Since he
cannot play a piece very often without having a number of errors,
rearrangements, slight changes creeping into it, he must, in order to
eliminate them and to cleanse the piece, return from time to time to
slow practice in which he also refrains almost entirely from expression.
When in the next public performance the right tempo and expression are
added again they tend strongly to renew the freshness of the piece in
the player's mind.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">Pg 124</a></span></p>

<p>It is just possible that your friends and your mother may not be
amenable to the high class of music which you play, but if this is not
the case your affliction cannot be cured offhand. If the lack of
expression in your playing should emanate from a lack of feeling in
yourself, then your case would be incurable. If, however, you play
"mechanically" because you do not know how to express your emotions in
your playing&mdash;and I suspect it to be so&mdash;then you are curable,
although there are no remedies that would act directly. I suggest that
you form close associations with good musicians and with lovers of good
music. By looking well and listening you can learn their modes of
expression and employ them first by imitation until the habit of "saying
something" when you play has grown upon you. I think, though, that you
need an inward change before there can be any outward change.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>The Art of Playing With Feeling</i></div>

<p>In the musical manifestations of feeling how does the artist chiefly
differ from the amateur?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">Pg 125</a></span></p>

<p>The artist expresses his feelings with due deference to the canons of
art. Above all, he plays correctly without allowing this ever-present
correctness to make his playing seem lacking in feeling. Without unduly
repressing or suppressing his individuality he respects the composer's
intentions by punctiliously obeying every hint or suggestion he finds in
the annotations, concerning speed, force, touch, changes, contrasts,
etc. He delivers the composer's message truthfully. His personality or
individuality reveals itself solely in the way he understands the
composition and in the manner in which he executes the composer's
prescriptions.</p>

<p>Not so the amateur. Long before he is able to play the piece correctly
he begins to twist and turn things in it to suit himself, under the
belief, I suppose, that he is endowed with an "individuality" so strong
as to justify an indulgence in all manner of "liberties," that is,
licence. Feeling is a great thing; so is the will to express it; but
both are worthless without ability. Hence, before playing with feeling,
it were well to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">Pg 126</a></span>
sure that everything in the piece is in
the right place, in the right time, strength, touch, and so forth.
Correct reading&mdash;and not only of the notes <i>per se</i>&mdash;is a
matter that every good teacher insists upon with his pupils, even in the
earliest grades of advancement. The amateur should make sure of that
before he allows his "feelings" to run riot. But he very seldom does.</p>

<p>All such actions as you describe reveal a lack of the player's proper
self-control when they are unconsciously indulged in. When they are
consciously committed, which is not infrequently the case, they betray
the pianist's effort to deflect the auditors' attention from the
composition to himself, feeling probably unable to satisfy his auditors
with the result of his playing and, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">Pg 127</a></span>resorting to

<p>Do you believe that the piano is the most difficult of all instruments

<p>The piano is more difficult to master than the organ, because the
tone-production on the piano is not so purely mechanical as it is on the
organ. The pianist's touch is the immediate producer of whatever variety
or colour of tone the moment requires, whereas the organist is powerless
to produce any change of tone colour except by pulling a different stop.
His fingers do not and cannot produce the change. As to string
instruments, their difficulties lie in an entirely different field, and
this fact precludes comparison with the piano. Technically, the string
instrument may be more difficult, but, to become an exponent of musical
art on the piano requires deeper study, because the pianist must

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why the Piano Is So Popular</i></div>

<p>Why do more people play the piano than any other instrument?</p>

<p>Because the rudimentary stages of music study are easier on the piano
than on any other instrument. The higher stages, however, are so much
more difficult, and it is then that the piano
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">Pg 129</a></span> gets even with
the bold aggressor. A violinist or 'cellist who can play a melody simply
and with good tone is considered a fairly good amateur, for he must have
mastered the difficulty of tone-production; he must have trained his
right arm. A pianist who can play a melody equally well is the merest
tyro. When he approaches polyphony, when the discrimination begins
between the various parts speaking simultaneously, aye, then the real
work begins&mdash;not to speak of velocity. It is, perhaps, for this
reason that in reality there are a great many more violinists than
pianists, if by either we mean persons who really master their
instrument. The number of 'cellists is smaller, but the reason for this
is to be found in the small range of 'cello literature and also,
perhaps, in the comparative unwieldiness of the instrument, which does
not admit of technical development as, for instance, the more handy
violin. If all beginners at the piano realized what exasperating,
harassing, discouraging, nerve-consuming difficulties await them later
and beset the path to that mastery which so few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">Pg 130</a></span> achieve, there
would be far fewer piano students and more people would study the violin

<p>The best piano hand is not the popular, pretty, narrow hand with long
fingers. Nearly all the great technicians had or have proportioned
hands. The genuine piano hand must be broad, in order to give each
finger a strong base for the action of its phalanges and to give this
base space enough for the development of the various sets of muscles.

<p>Do you think I should play and study the piano just because it is asked
of me, and when I take no interest in it?</p>

<p>Most emphatically, no! It would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">Pg 133</a></span> a crime against yourself and
against music. What little interest in music you may have left would be
killed by a study that is distasteful to you, and this would be,
therefore, bound to lead to failure. Leave this study to people who are
sincerely interested in it. Thank heaven, there are still some of those,
and there always will be some! Be sure, however, that you are really not
interested, and discriminate well between a lack of interest and a mere
opposition to a perhaps too strenuous urging on the part of your
relatives. My advice would be to quit the study for a time entirely; if,
after a while, you feel a craving for music you will find the way to
your instrument. This advice, of course, holds good also for violin
students or any type of music student.</p>

If you associate with the noble thoughts that
constitute good&mdash;or, as you call it, classical&mdash;music, you
will be counted with a higher class in the world of music. Remember that
you cannot go through a flour-mill without getting dusty. Of course, not
all pieces of dance music are bad; but the general run of them are such
poor, if not vulgar, stuff as hardly to deserve the name of
"compositions." Usually they are mere "expositions" of bad taste. Of
these I warn you for your own sake, and if you wish to avoid the danger

<p>Yes, it would if the pianos were not pitched alike. It is only recently

1859, in Paris, by a government commission, numbering among its members
such men as Auber, Hal&#xe9;vy, Berlioz, Meyerbeer, Rossini, Ambroise Thomas,

that, in determining that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">Pg 137</a></span>

<p>There is no difference on the piano. But acoustically there is a

<p>The effect of a tonality upon our hearing lies not in its signature (as
even Beethoven seemed to believe) but in the vibration proportions. It
is, therefore, irrelevant whether we play a piece upon a high-pitched
piano in C, or upon a low-pitched piano in D flat. There are certain
keys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">Pg 138</a></span>
preferable to others for certain colours, but I fear that
the preference is based not upon acoustic qualities but rather upon a
fitness for the hand or voice. We apply the word "colour" as much to
tone as the painters apply "tone" to colour, but I hardly think that
anybody would speak of C major as representing black, or F major green.</p>

<p>The usual age for a child to begin the study of music is between six and

<p>If music is to be merely a pastime, and you content yourself with a

become musical in a better sense, why, by all means, apply to a teacher
of the better class. The maxim: "For the beginning this or that is good

For the higher study of an executive specialty
(piano, violin, the voice, etc.) I should naturally prefer private
instruction from a specialist, because he can give more attention to
each individual pupil than is possible under the wholesale system
followed, not by all, but by the majority of music schools. What I
should advise would be a combination: General matters&mdash;harmony,
counterpoint, forms, history, and &#xe6;sthetics&mdash;in a music school; and
private lessons for your specialty from a teacher who has an established
name as an executive artist. The best music schools have such a man at
their head, and in these you find the best combination.</p>

<p>Your question does not admit of generalization from a purely musical

better than a bad masculine one, and

his teacher's ability, rather the reverse. He may possibly find his
teacher unsympathetic, but even this matter he is apt to judge

these few, all great musicians were "wonder-children," whether they
became composers, pianists, violinists, 'cellists, or what not. The
biographies of our great masters of the past centuries as well as those
of more recent times (Mendelssohn, Wagner, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt,
Rubinstein, and all the others), will bear me out in this statement. If
your child shows more than mere precocity&mdash;if, for instance, he

orchestra or string quartette. The synthetic nature of the orchestra
forestalls the extravagances of so-called individuality and insures,
generally speaking, a truthful interpretation. The very worst conductor
imaginable cannot do as much harm to a composition as can a mediocre
soloist, for an orchestra is a large body and, therefore, not so easily
moved and shifted from the path of musical rectitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">Pg 155</a></span> as is a
single voice or an instrument. A really great soloist is, of course, the
finest flower of the garden of applied music, for his touch with the
instrument is immediate and he needs no middleman to express the finest
shades of his conceptions; while the conductor&mdash;and even the
best&mdash;has to impart his conception (through the baton, facial
expression, and gesture) to other people before it can become audible,
and on this circuitous route much of the original fervour and ardour may
be lost. But there are more good orchestras than great soloists, and
hence you are safe in attending orchestra and chamber-music concerts.</p>

<p>Compelled to study without a teacher for two years before I can go to a
conservatory, what method should I study for my technique and what
pieces?</p>

<p>You fail to say whether you are a beginner or already somewhat advanced.
Still, I think it safe to recommend Mason's "Touch and Technique,"
Sternberg's Etudes, opus 66; and select your pieces from the graded
catalogues which any publisher will be glad to send you.<span class="pagenum"><a

<div class="sidenote"><i>Music as a Profession or as an Avocation</i></div>

<p>Would you advise a young man with a good foundation to choose
music&mdash;that is, concertizing&mdash;as a career, or should he keep
his music as an accomplishment and avocation?</p>

<p>Your distinguishing between music and concertizing gives direction to my
reply; that the question was not answered by your own heart before you
asked it prompts me to advise music for you as an avocation. The
artist's career nowadays is not so simple as it appears to be. Of a
thousand capable musicians there is, perhaps, one who attains to a
general reputation and fortune. The rest of them, after spending money,
time, and toil, give up in despair, and with an embittered disposition
take up some other occupation. If you do not depend upon public
music-making for a living; if your natural endowments are not of a very
unusually high order, and if your entire personality does not imply the
exercise of authority over assemblages of people&mdash;spiritual
authority, I mean&mdash;it were better to enjoy your music in the circle
of your friends. It is less risky and will, in all probability, give you
much greater satisfaction.

<div class="sidenote"><i>How Much You Can Get From Music</i></div>

<p>When I hear a concert pianist I want to get more from his playing than
&#xe6;sthetic ear enjoyment. Can you give me a little outline of points for
which to look that may help me in my piano study?</p>

<p>There is no pleasure or enjoyment from which we can derive more than we
bring with us in the way of receptiveness. As you deepen your study of
music and gain insight into its forms, contrapuntal work and harmonic
beauties you will derive more and more pleasure from listening to a good
pianist the deeper your studies go. What their playing reflects of
emotional life you will perceive in the exact measure of your own grasp
upon life. Art is a medium connecting, like a telegraph, two stations:
the sender of a message and the receiver. Both must be pitched equally
high to make the communication perfect.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote">"<i>It is So Much Easier to Read Flats Than Sharps!</i>"</div>

<p>You would confer a favour upon a teacher by solving a problem for her
that has puzzled her all her life; why do all pupils prefer flats to
sharps? I am not at all sure that I do not, in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">Pg 158</a></span> degree,
share this preference. Is it a fault of training, or has it any other cause?</p>

<p>Your question is both original and well justified by frequent
observation, for it is quite true that people prefer to read flats to
sharps. But note it well that the aversion to sharps refers only to the
reading, not to the playing. If any one should find it harder to <i>play</i>
in sharps, say, after knowing the notes well, it would be a purely
subjective deception, due to a mental association of the note-picture
with the respective sounds. My personal belief is that the aversion to
the <i>reading</i> of sharps is caused by the comparative complexity of the
sign itself, and this leads me to think that the whole matter belongs
rather to ophthalmology than to either acoustics or music.</p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>Rubinstein or Liszt&mdash;Which the Greater?</i></div>

<p>As between Liszt and Rubinstein, whom do you consider the greater?</p>

<p>Rubinstein I knew very well (I was his pupil), and have heard him play a
great many times. Liszt, who died when I was sixteen years old and had
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">Pg 159</a></span>
appeared in public for some twenty years previously, I
never met and never heard. Still, from the descriptions which many of my
friends gave me of him, and from the study of his works, I have been
able to form a fair idea of his playing and his personality. As a
virtuoso I think Liszt stood above Rubinstein, for his playing must have
possessed amazing, dazzling qualities. Rubinstein excelled by his
sincerity, by his demoniacal, Heaven-storming power of great
impassionedness, qualities which with Liszt had passed through the sieve
of a superior education and&mdash;if you understand how I mean that
term&mdash;gentlemanly elegance. He was, in the highest meaning of the
word, a man of the world; Rubinstein, a world-stormer, with a sovereign
disregard for conventionality and for Mrs. Grundy. The principal
difference lay in the characters of the two. As musicians, with regard
to their natural endowments and ability, they were probably of the same
gigantic calibre, such as we would seek in vain at the present
time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">Pg 160</a></span></p>

<div class="section">
<div class="sidenote"><i>As to One Composer&mdash;Excluding All Others</i></div>

<p>If I am deeply interested in Beethoven's music can I not find in him all
that there is in music, in both an &#xe6;sthetic and a technical sense? Is
any one's music more profound?</p>

<p>You imagine yourself in an impenetrable stronghold whence, safe from all
attacks, you may look upon all composers (except Beethoven) with a
patronizing, condescending smile. But you are gravely in error. Life is
too rich in experience, too many-sided in its manifestations, to permit
any one master, however great, to exhaust its interpretation through his
art. If you base your preference for Beethoven upon your sympathies, and
if, for this reason, his music satisfies you better than that of any
other composer, you are to be complimented upon your good taste. But
that gives you no right to contest, for instance, the profoundness of
Bach, the &#xe6;sthetic charm of Chopin, the wonders of Mozart's art, nor the
many and various merits of your contemporary composers. The least that
one can be charged with who finds the whole of life expressed in
any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">Pg 161</a></span>
one composer is one-sidedness, not to speak of the fact
that the understanding cannot be very deep for one master if it is
closed to all others. One of the chief requirements for true
connoisseurship is catholicity of taste.</p>

<p>I am fifty-six years old, live in the mountains sixty-five miles from
any railroad, alone with my husband, and I have not taken lessons in
thirty-five years. Do you think "Pischna" would help me much to regain
my former ability to play? If not, what would you advise me to do?</p>

<p>Refrain from all especially technical work. Since your love of music is
strong enough to cause you to resume your playing you should take as
much pleasure in it as possible and work technically only in the pieces
you play&mdash;that is, in those places which offer you difficulties.
Decide upon a comfortable fingering first, and practise the difficult
places separately and slowly until you feel that you can venture to play
them in their appropriate speed.

<p>What pieces would you advise me to memorize after Rachmaninoff's Prelude

to the majority of people, but I enjoy them.</p>

<p>If such a work as Chopin's Ballade in A-flat does not "appeal to the
majority"&mdash;as you say&mdash;the fault cannot lie in the
composition, but must be sought in the interpretation. Why not try a few
pieces of lesser complexity and play them so perfectly that they do
appeal to the majority. Try Chopin's Nocturne, opus 27, No. 2;
Schumann's Romanza, opus. 28, No. 2; or his "Traumerei," or some of the
more pretentious "Songs Without Words" by Mendelssohn.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>About Starting on a Concert Career</i></div>

<p>I am twenty-four, have had four years' rigorous work in a conservatory
and a partial college training. My technique is adequate for Brahms's
Rhapsody in G minor and McDowell's Sonatas. I have good health and am
determined not to grow self-satisfied. Is there a place on the concert
stage&mdash;even if only as an accompanist&mdash;for a woman thus
equipped?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">Pg 163</a></span></p><br/>

<p>Any public career must begin by earning the good opinion of others.
One's own opinion, however just, is never a criterion. My advice is that
you speak to some of the prominent concert agents, whose names and
addresses you find in every well-accredited music paper. Play for them.
They are usually not connoisseurs by actual knowledge, but they have
developed a fine instinct for that which is of use to them, and you are,
of course, aware that we must be of use to others before we can be of
use to ourselves. If the right "stuff" is in you you will make your way.
People of ability always do. That there is room for women on the concert
stage is proved by the great array of meritorious women pianists.
Especially for accompanying women are in demand&mdash;that is, for
<i>good</i> accompanying. But I would not start out with the idea of
accompanying. It seems like going to a commercial school to study be to
an "assistant" bookkeeper. Become a fine, all-round musician, a fine
pianist, and see what the tide of affairs will bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">Pg 164</a></span> you. The
proper level for your ability is bound to disclose itself to you.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Accompanist Usually Precedes Soloist at Entering</i></div>

<p>Should an accompanist precede or follow the soloist on the stage in a
concert or recital, and should sex be considered in the matter?</p>

<p>If the soloist be a man the accompanist should precede him on the stage
in order to arrange his music, the height of his seat or whatever may be
necessary, during which time the soloist salutes the audience. For these
reasons it should be the same when the soloist is a woman, but as women
are of the feminine persuasion it will, perhaps, look better if the
accompanist yields precedence to her.

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
